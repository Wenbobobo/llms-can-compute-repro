# llms-can-compute-repro

Careful reproduction of a narrowed execution-substrate reading of Percepta's
field note _Can LLMs Be Computers?_

This repository tracks a paper-grade endpoint:

1. deterministic computation can be encoded as an append-only execution trace;
2. exact latest-write retrieval over that trace can be implemented with
   structured 2D hard-max retrieval;
3. on the current validated scope, those primitives support a small exact
   executor and a tiny typed-bytecode `D0` compiled endpoint.

This repository does **not** claim that general LLMs are computers, that
arbitrary C has been reproduced, or that demo-first presentation is evidence.

## Current Boundary

| Track | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| `M0-M3` | repo scaffold, claim discipline, geometry core, and append-only trace executor are in place |
| `M4-M5` | exact retrieval/executor branches, staged-pointer caveats, and softmax negative controls remain recorded without widening |
| `M6-M7` | the tiny typed-bytecode boundary is implemented and validated; widening remains blocked |
| `P1-P10` | paper bundle, public-safe packaging, bundle-lock audits, and archive handoff remain active |
| `H4-H5` | bounded return packet completed and preserved as historical scientific baseline |
| `H6-H7` | bounded exactness/mechanism packet completed and preserved as the deeper baseline underneath the current stage |
| `H8-H9` | completed bounded `D0` long-horizon packet: `H8` replaced the driver, `R6` completed the long-horizon scaling gate, `R7` preserved the full `8`-family exact-admitted surface but profiled only the top `4` heaviest representatives, and `H9` refroze the packet |
| `H10-H12` | completed bounded `D0` retrieval-pressure packet: `H10` reconciles `R7` to artifact-backed wording, `H11` replaces the driver, `R8` stresses higher retrieval pressure on the same endpoint, `R9` keeps real-trace precision companion-only, `R10` attributes same-endpoint costs, and `H12` refreezes the packet |
| `H13-V1` | completed governance/runtime handoff preserved as a control baseline: `H13` kept the completed checkpoint explicit, `V1` classified the slow full-suite `pytest -q` gate as `healthy_but_slow`, and outward-sync audits were tightened without widening scope |
| `H14-H15` | completed bounded core-first reopen/refreeze packet: `H14` locked the reopened lane to exact 2D retrieval plus append-only/latest-write execution, `R11/R12` landed on bounded evidence, `R13` stayed inactive, `R14` stayed unjustified, and `H15` refroze the repo on the same endpoint |
| `H16-H17` | completed bounded same-scope reopen/refreeze packet: `H16` kept the same `D0` endpoint active after `H15`, `R15` and `R16` closed the remaining-family retrieval-pressure and admitted precision surfaces, `R17` landed as the full-surface runtime stop result, `R18a` failed its narrow decomp-first gate, `R18b` then closed the runtime repair packet with exact `8/8` confirmation, and `H17` refroze the repo on the same endpoint |
| `H18-H19` | completed bounded same-endpoint mainline reopen/refreeze packet: `H18` kept the `D0` scope lock explicit, `R19` confirmed admitted-plus-heldout same-endpoint runtime generalization, `R20` supported the mechanism on a fixed `16`-row probe set, `R21` did not expose a failure inside the bounded `48`-branch executor grid, and `H19` refroze the packet as the current machine-readable state |
| `H20-H21` | completed post-`H19` reentry/refreeze packet: `H20` isolated dirty-tree hygiene from the next science lanes, `R22` extended the bounded executor-boundary scan to `102/102` executed candidates without localizing a failure, `R23` reran the full positive `D0` systems universe and kept `pointer_like_exact` exact on `25/25` rows but still failed to overturn the mixed systems gate, and `H21` refroze the packet as the current machine-readable state; the downstream `P12` closeout is now preserved and the current planning-only pre-next-phase wave is `R24/R25` |

## Current Gate Outcome

- The current active stage still starts from the locked submission-candidate
  bundle and restrained release-candidate checkpoint created by `P8/P9`.
- The precision story remains bounded rather than broad: float32 single-head
  fails on `12/25` tracked real/organic streams, `7/25` already at `1x`, while
  at least one decomposition stays exact on `25/25` tracked streams in the
  validated suite.
- The systems gate remains mixed: geometry is strongly positive, but the
  lowered path is still about `1.82x` slower than the best current
  reference/oracle path on positive `D0` suites.
- `R6` keeps the completed long-horizon packet positive on the same endpoint:
  `24/24` fixed-multiplier rows stay admitted, `8/8` longer-row decode-parity
  checks match exactly, and the narrow multiplier-`8` precision companion
  finds `4/8` boundary-bearing streams while the weaker control fails on `2/4`
  of those boundary-bearing rows.
- `R7` preserved the full `8`-family exact-admitted `R6` index but only
  profiled the top `4` heaviest family representatives on the same endpoint;
  all `4/4` profiled rows stayed exact, accelerated Hull decode reached only
  about `0.973x` of linear on median, and it still ran about `1980.3x` slower
  per step than the lowered path.
- `R8` stresses higher retrieval pressure on the same endpoint and is now
  closed on a bounded harder-family gate: `4/4` exact rows remain admitted,
  the bounded top-`2` decode-parity probe matches on `2/2` rows, and
  retrieval pressure grows to about `1.249x` max events and `1.560x` max
  total candidate depth versus the admitted `R6` `8x` source rows.
- `R9` keeps real-trace precision companion-only and is now closed on the
  admitted `R8` memory streams: all `4/4` screened streams stay
  `effective_here`, one `single_head` `tie_collapse` appears at `1x` on the
  helper-checkpoint-braid-long stream, the default decomposition grid still
  passes there, and the weaker negative control does not fail.
- `R10` attributes same-endpoint costs and is now closed on representative
  admitted rows: median exact-versus-lowered runtime is still about
  `2429.1x`, median retrieval share is about `99.8%`, harness share is
  effectively negligible, and retrieval dominates on `4/4` profiled rows.
- `H8/R6/R7/H9` now sits as the completed direct same-endpoint baseline, while
  `H6/R3/R4/(inactive R5)/H7` remains the older exactness/mechanism baseline
  underneath it.
- `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` is now the latest completed same-endpoint follow-up
  packet rather than the active science lane. It keeps the same endpoint
  fixed, closes `R8/R9/R10` on bounded evidence, and leaves `H12` as the
  completed refreeze lane for the current scientific checkpoint.
- `H13/V1` remains preserved as the completed governance/runtime handoff:
  `pytest --collect-only -q` succeeds on the current suite, the bounded top-`6`
  timing follow-up classifies full `pytest -q` as healthy but multi-minute,
  and outward-sync control remains machine-audited.
- The current active post-`P9` stage is
  `H21_refreeze_after_r22_r23`. It refreezes the landed
  `H20/R22/R23` follow-up on top of the preserved `H18/R19/R20/R21/H19`
  packet, keeps the endpoint locked to tiny typed bytecode `D0`, and leaves
  any later frontier review planning-only rather than activated.
- `H15_refreeze_and_decision_sync` is now the preserved prior refreeze and
  decision record. It still records `R13` as inactive and `R14` as
  unjustified on the fixed `D0` endpoint.
- `H14_core_first_reopen_and_scope_lock` is now the completed reopened packet
  underneath the active `H16` packet. That packet kept work bounded to exact
  `2D` geometry plus append-only/latest-write execution, ran `R11` before
  `R12`, left `R13` inactive, and left `R14` downstream rather than
  authorizing compiled widening by wording alone.
- `R11` has now closed on a bounded current-code re-audit: the geometry parity
  slice stays exact on `5/5` audited cases, preserved cache-versus-bruteforce
  speedup ranges from about `42.8x` to `249.2x`, and same-endpoint lowered-path
  speedup wording remains blocked.
- `R12` has now closed on a bounded reopened executor export: current
  `exact_linear`, `exact_accelerated`, and bounded `trainable_stack` modes all
  remain exact on the exported suites, the longest heldout countdown still
  reaches `104` steps, and the next harder-slice inventory is explicit across
  `24` staged `R6` rows plus `4` staged `R8` rows.
- `R15` has now closed the bounded remaining-family retrieval-pressure gate:
  all `4/4` remaining-family harder rows stay admitted, the bounded top-`2`
  decode-parity probe matches on `2/2` rows, and remaining-family retrieval
  pressure rises to about `1.248x` max event growth plus about `1.557x` max
  total candidate-depth growth versus the admitted `R6` `8x` source rows.
- `R15` complements rather than replaces `R8`: together they now cover all
  `8` current `R6` families with bounded same-endpoint retrieval-pressure
  evidence.
- `R16` has now closed the bounded real-trace precision saturation follow-up
  on that admitted `R8/R15` memory surface: all `8/8` screened streams remain
  `effective_here`, only the preserved helper-checkpoint-braid-long stream
  enters boundary follow-up, the default decomposition grid still passes there,
  and the weaker base-`256` control does not fail.
- `R17` has now closed the bounded full-surface same-endpoint runtime bridge:
  all `8/8` admitted runtime rows stay exact, median
  accelerated-versus-linear speedup is only about `1.0019x`, median
  accelerated-versus-lowered ratio is still about `1257.5x`, focused
  attribution on the preserved boundary-bearing `R8` row plus the heaviest
  admitted `R15` row remains retrieval-dominated, and `R18` is therefore
  conditionally activated only around
  `helper_checkpoint_braid_long/retrieval_total`.
- `R18a` first measured the narrow decomp-first counterfactual on that named
  target and failed its `2.0x` gate, but `R18b` then closed the comparator-only
  repair packet: pointer-like exact retrieval stayed exact on the focused
  target plus matched control, the target reached about `1308.5x` versus the
  recorded `R17` accelerated baseline, and the admitted `8/8` confirmation
  sweep stayed exact with about `1252.7x` median speedup versus the recorded
  `R17` accelerated baseline.
- `H17` is now preserved as the prior same-scope refreeze and frontier-review
  decision record for the completed `H16/R15/R16/R17/R18` packet.
- `H18` has now exported that planning guard as
  `results/H18_post_h17_mainline_reopen_guard/summary.json`, keeping the
  `D0` scope lock explicit while moving the unattended handoff into `R19`.
- `R19` has now closed the first admitted-plus-heldout same-endpoint runtime
  gate: `pointer_like_exact` stayed exact on admitted `8/8` plus heldout
  `16/16` rows, no heldout family failed, and median pointer-like speedup
  reached about `396.9x` versus current accelerated on admitted rows plus
  about `457.0x` on heldout rows.
- `R20` has now closed the bounded same-endpoint mechanism ablation lane:
  `pointer_like_exact` stayed exact on the fixed `16/16` `R19`-derived sample
  set, median pointer-like speedup versus imported current accelerated reached
  about `392.6x`, and both negative controls failed on `16/16` rows.
- `R21` has now closed the bounded exact-executor boundary map on the same
  endpoint: `pointer_like_exact` stayed exact on `96/96` executed candidates
  across the fixed `48`-branch grid, and no branch failures were observed
  inside that bounded scan.
- `H19` has now recorded the preserved post-`H18` frozen same-endpoint control
  state:
  `decision_state = same_endpoint_refreeze_complete`,
  `runtime_generalization_verdict = same_endpoint_generalization_confirmed`,
  `mechanism_verdict = mechanism_supported`,
  `boundary_verdict = no_boundary_break_detected`,
  `future_frontier_review_state = planning_only_conditionally_reviewable`, and
  `historical_next_priority_lane = p13_public_surface_sync_and_repo_hygiene`.
- `H20` has now exported the post-`H19` reentry and hygiene split guard,
  keeping the dirty-tree isolation problem explicit before `R22` and `R23`
  landed.
- `R22` has now closed the harder same-endpoint boundary follow-up:
  all `102/102` executed candidates stayed exact, no boundary failure was
  localized, and the next lane remained `R23`.
- `R23` has now closed the same-endpoint systems overturn follow-up on the full
  positive `D0` suite: `pointer_like_exact` stayed exact on `25/25` rows and
  improved sharply versus imported accelerated, but still remained about
  `4.16x` slower than the best current reference path, so the lane verdict is
  `systems_still_mixed`.
- `H21` has now recorded the post-`R22/R23` frozen same-endpoint state:
  `decision_state = post_r22_r23_refreeze_complete`,
  `boundary_verdict = extended_grid_no_break_still_not_localized`,
  `systems_verdict = systems_still_mixed`,
  `future_frontier_review_state = planning_only_conditionally_reviewable`, and
  `next_priority_lane = p12_manuscript_and_manifest_maintenance`.
- that `H21` machine state still does not authorize a frontier run: any later
  broader review remains blocked behind the planning-only
  `F2_future_frontier_recheck_activation_matrix`, the machine-state downstream
  handoff to `P12_manuscript_and_manifest_maintenance` has now been closed out
  in docs, the current planning-only pre-next-phase wave is `R24/R25`, and
  `P13` remains a later outward-sync / hygiene lane rather than the next
  scientific handoff.
- V1 remains a standing operational reference under the preserved `H13`
  handoff rather than an active science lane.
- The compiled endpoint remains tiny typed bytecode `D0`; no active lane
  authorizes frontend widening, arbitrary compiled-language claims, or a
  broader “LLMs are computers” thesis.
- `E1c` stays conditional only and contradiction-only throughout the packet.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` — milestone logs, plans, claim ledgers, publication notes
- `src/` — geometry, trace execution, model branches, typed-bytecode harness
- `scripts/` — export and rendering entrypoints
- `tests/` — regression and artifact tests
- `results/` — tracked benchmark summaries and milestone outputs

## Public Material Policy

`docs/Origin/` and `docs/origin/` contain local-only source material and stay
out of version control. The public repository stores derived notes, code,
benchmark outputs, claim ledgers, and explicit accounting of what was and was
not reproduced.
