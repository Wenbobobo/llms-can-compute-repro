# Branch And Worktree Registry

This file records the current tight-core keep set, quarantine posture, and
cleanup priorities for the clean-descendant-only repo state.

## Tight Core Keep Set

| Role | Branch | Path | State | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| published clean descendant | `wip/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep` | `D:/zWenbo/AI/wt/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep` | clean published source | keep as the stable published clean descendant |
| current hygiene execution successor | `wip/p63-post-p62-tight-core-hygiene` | `D:/zWenbo/AI/wt/p63-post-p62-tight-core-hygiene` | mutable local execution lane | keep as the only active successor branch for this hygiene-first follow-through |
| preserved local integration base | `wip/p56-main-scratch` | `D:/zWenbo/AI/wt/p56-main-scratch` | local integration ancestry only | keep preserved; do not treat as the live published branch |
| dirty-root quarantine | `wip/root-main-parking-2026-03-24` | `D:/zWenbo/AI/LLMCompute` | operationally dirty root checkout | quarantine only; never use as a clean integration base |

## Historical But Preserved

- the archive-first docs-only chain under `D:/zWenbo/AI/wt/`
  (`wip/h64-post-h63-archive-first-freeze`,
  `wip/f38-post-h62-archive-first-closeout`,
  `wip/f37-post-h61-hygiene-first-reauth-prep`,
  `wip/f36-post-h60-archive-first-consolidation`,
  `wip/f34-post-h59-archive-and-reopen-screen`,
  `wip/f32-post-h56-last-discriminator`) remains read-only historical support
  for the current closeout posture
- older worktrees under `D:/zWenbo/AI/LLMCompute-worktrees/` are preserved
  historical branches; no new active work should start there during this phase

## Cleanup Candidates

- the local-only ancestor chain
  `wip/p16-h25-clean -> wip/r32-next -> wip/r33-next` is no longer part of the
  active route
- if one preserved tip is still desired, keep only `wip/r33-next` as the sole
  reminder of that chain
- `wip/p16-h25-clean` and `wip/r32-next` are the first explicit delete-local
  candidates after this registry has been reviewed and mirrored in a later
  cleanup pass

## Merge Rules

- merge posture remains `clean_descendant_only_never_dirty_root_main`
- `wip/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep` remains the published
  clean source for current live control wording
- `wip/p63-post-p62-tight-core-hygiene` is a successor work branch, not a new
  published milestone by itself
- runtime remains closed
- `F38/R63` remains dormant and non-runtime only
