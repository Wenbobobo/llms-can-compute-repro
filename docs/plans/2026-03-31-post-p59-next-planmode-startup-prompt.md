Please in plan mode:

1. Start from the landed `H64 + P56/P57/P58/P59` state rather than reopen
   momentum.
2. First decide whether the next route should be archive polish, publication
   polish, merge-prep follow-through, explicit promotion-prep, explicit stop,
   or no further action.
3. Produce one recommended main route first. If you discuss alternatives, rank
   them clearly and explain why the recommended route dominates.
4. Only discuss `R63` if you keep it strictly non-runtime and specify a
   genuinely new admissibility profile with useful target, honest comparator,
   cost share, query:insert ratio, tie burden, and a material cost-model delta
   from the closed `R62/H58` lane.
5. Do not reopen same-lane executor-value work, runtime authorization, broad
   Wasm, arbitrary `C`, transformed/trainable entry, or dirty-root
   integration.
6. Write the next-phase plan as explicit waves. For each wave include:
   objective, required inputs, expected outputs, stop conditions, go/no-go
   rule, expected commits, and whether a new worktree or subagent is needed.
7. Prefer clean-descendant-only publication, hygiene, promotion, and
   merge-prep work over speculative science.
