# Plans Index

This directory stores planning-only design documents, unattended master plans,
and packet-specific handoff notes. These files are routing aids, not
claim-bearing evidence. When a plan and a landed result differ, trust the
current stage driver, the milestone/result artifacts, and the machine-readable
`results/` summaries first.

## Current Start Points

- `2026-03-23-post-p20-f6-future-option-design.md` — the preserved design
  surface for the planning-only `F6_post_p20_future_option_matrix` lane.
- `2026-03-23-post-p20-f5-no-reopen-handoff-design.md` — the preserved
  post-`P20/F5` handoff surface that records the completed manuscript resync,
  the planning-only `no_reopen_candidate_survives` outcome, and the fact that
  there is still no active downstream runtime lane.
- `2026-03-23-post-r39-later-explicit-scope-decision-design.md` — the
  current preserved design surface for the landed post-`R39` docs-only scope
  decision packet, `H34_post_r39_later_explicit_scope_decision_packet`.
- `2026-03-23-post-h33-r39-origin-core-substrate-question-design.md` — the
  preserved design surface that led to the completed post-`H33`
  same-substrate audit, `R39_origin_compiler_control_surface_dependency_audit`.
- `2026-03-23-post-h32-conditional-next-packet-design.md` — the preserved
  post-`H32` planning surface that led to the landed docs-only `H33`
  question-selection packet.
- `2026-03-22-post-h30-h31-r38-extension-plan.md` — the current saved
  post-`H30` execution surface that landed the explicit later decision packet,
  one richer same-substrate extension gate, `H32` refreeze, and `P18`
  clean-worktree closeout.
- `2026-03-22-post-h30-explicit-next-wave-design.md` — the preserved pre-`H31`
  planning surface that required a later explicit packet before any further
  compiler-boundary extension.
- `2026-03-22-post-r36-explicit-next-wave-design.md` — the saved post-`R36`
  explicit-next-wave handoff that led to the landed `R37 -> H30` packet; keep
  it as pre-`H31` rationale rather than the current machine state.
- `2026-03-22-post-unattended-r32-mainline-design.md` — preserved historical
  same-endpoint handoff for the earlier `P16 -> R32 -> H26 -> R33/H27` route.
- `2026-03-21-h18-unattended-mainline-master-plan.md` — broad unattended
  master plan for the mainline reproduction program.
- `2026-03-22-post-h23-reauthorization-design.md` — the design that landed the
  preserved prior `H24/R30/R31/H25` reauthorization/refreeze packet.
- `2026-03-22-post-h25-r32-r33-near-term-design.md` — preserved historical
  near-term handoff for `R32` first and deferred `R33` second on the old
  same-endpoint route.

## Historical Plan Groups

- `2026-03-21-*` and `2026-03-22-*` — current post-`H30` / post-`H31` / `R38`
  design set plus the preserved post-`H19`, post-`H21`, post-`H23`, and
  post-`H25` design stack.
- `2026-03-20-*` — `H10` through `H17`, `R8` through `R18`, and release/control
  audit design set.
- `2026-03-19-*` — `H1` through `H9`, `R3` through `R7`, `P5` through `P10`,
  and early unattended governance/master-plan set.
- `2026-03-17-*` and `2026-03-18-*` — earliest bootstrap, exact hard-max,
  trainable latest-write, and first compiled-boundary planning set.

## Reading Rule

For current work, start with the newest plan in the relevant lane, then confirm
its status against:

1. `../publication_record/current_stage_driver.md`
2. `../../tmp/active_wave_plan.md`
3. the corresponding milestone `README.md` / `status.md`
4. the corresponding `results/<lane>/summary.json`

Do not treat an older plan as authorization to reopen a blocked lane.
When a saved plan and the current `H34/H32/H33/R39/R38/H31/H30` packet differ,
trust the landed packet.
