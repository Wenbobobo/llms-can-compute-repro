# Plans Index

This directory stores planning-only design documents, unattended master plans,
and packet-specific handoff notes. These files are routing aids, not
claim-bearing evidence. When a plan and a landed result differ, trust the
current stage driver, the milestone/result artifacts, and the machine-readable
`results/` summaries first.

## Current Start Points

- `2026-03-24-post-h49-origin-core-next-wave-design.md` — the current saved
  post-`H49` next-wave design that fixed and now closes the route:
  `F26 -> P36 -> R51 -> R52 -> H50`, while keeping `F27` saved but blocked.
- `2026-03-24-post-h47-p35-f23-mainline-extension-master-plan.md` — the
  current saved post-`H47` master plan that fixes the next wave order:
  `P35` research-record rollup, `F23` numeric-scaling bundle, one narrow
  `R49` runtime gate, and later explicit `H48` stop/go interpretation.
- `2026-03-24-post-h47-p35-research-record-rollup-design.md` — the current
  low-priority operational/docs design surface that records artifact policy,
  root-dirty quarantine, push state, merge posture, and preserved negative
  results after landed `H47`.
- `2026-03-24-post-h47-f23-numeric-scaling-bundle-design.md` — the current
  planning surface for the only admissible post-`H47` runtime question,
  fixing `R49` as the only next runtime candidate while keeping `H47/H43`
  intact.
- `2026-03-24-post-r49-h48-numeric-scaling-decision-design.md` — the
  preserved prior docs-only decision surface that reads completed `R49`,
  records landed `H48`, and authorizes exactly `F25` as the next planning-only
  bundle.
- `2026-03-24-post-h48-f25-restricted-tinyc-lowering-design.md` — the current
  planning surface for the only admissible post-`H48` runtime question,
  fixing `R50` as the only next runtime candidate and `H49` as the only
  follow-up packet while preserving the `R47` useful-case contract first.
- `2026-03-24-post-r50-h49-tinyc-lowering-decision-design.md` — the preserved
  prior docs-only decision surface that reads completed `R50`, records landed
  `H49`, freezes `R50` as narrow exact tiny-`C` support only, and restores
  `no_active_downstream_runtime_lane`.
- `2026-03-24-post-f25-r50-restricted-tinyc-lowering-design.md` — the current
  execution design surface for the landed `R50` restricted tiny-`C` lowering
  gate, preserving `H48/H43`, executing only the admitted single-function
  static `i32` surface, and handing interpretation to `H49`.

  saved `F23` buckets, and handing interpretation to `H48`.
- `2026-03-24-post-h43-mainline-reentry-master-plan.md` — the current
  post-`H43` saved master plan that fixes the exact-first reentry wave order:
  `Wave 0` save/fork/reindex, `F21` exact-first planning bundle, `H44`
  docs-only route reauthorization packet, `R46` exact surface-generalization
  gate, conditional `R47`, conditional `R48`, and later low-priority rollup.
- `2026-03-24-post-r48-h47-useful-case-bridge-refreeze-design.md` — the
  preserved prior execution design surface for the landed docs-only `H47`

For current work, start with the newest plan in the relevant lane, then confirm
its status against:

1. `../publication_record/current_stage_driver.md`
2. `../../tmp/active_wave_plan.md`
3. the corresponding milestone `README.md` / `status.md`
4. the corresponding `results/<lane>/summary.json`

Do not treat an older plan as authorization to reopen a blocked lane. When a
saved plan and the landed
`H45/H44/H43/H42/H41/F21/F20/R46/H40/R42/H36/P27/P26/F16/F17/F18/F19/H38/H37/P25/F15/H35/P24/R40` stack
differ, trust the landed packet.
