# Post-P71 Next Plan-Mode Startup Prompt

Current locked facts:

- The active docs-only packet is
  `H65_post_p66_p67_p68_archive_first_terminal_freeze_packet`.
- The current hygiene-only cleanup stack is
  `P69_post_h65_repo_graph_hygiene_inventory`,
  `P70_post_p69_archive_index_and_artifact_policy_sync`,
  `P71_post_p70_clean_descendant_merge_prep_readiness_sync`.
- The current frozen successor stack is
  `P66_post_p65_successor_publication_review`,
  `P67_post_p66_published_successor_freeze`,
  `P68_post_p67_release_hygiene_and_control_rebaseline`.
- The landed earlier follow-through stack is
  `P56_post_h64_clean_merge_candidate_packet`,
  `P57_post_h64_paper_submission_package_sync`,
  `P58_post_h64_archive_release_closeout_sync`,
  `P59_post_h64_control_and_handoff_sync`.
- The current hygiene-only cleanup branch is
  `wip/p69-post-h65-hygiene-only-cleanup`.
- The current published clean-descendant branch is
  `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze`.
- `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze` is a linear clean-descendant
  successor above `wip/p56-main-scratch` (`0/17` across
  `wip/p56-main-scratch...wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze`).
- A read-only `git merge-tree` probe against the merge base of
  `wip/p56-main-scratch` and `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze`
  shows no content-conflict markers; if merge-prep is discussed, it must start
  from `wip/p56-main-scratch`, not dirty root `main`.
- Dirty root `main` remains quarantine-only.
- Merge posture remains `clean_descendant_only_never_dirty_root_main`.
- `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze` remains far ahead of
  `origin/main` (`0/158` across
  `origin/main...wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze`).
- Runtime remains closed.
- `F38` / `R63` remain dormant and non-runtime only.
- `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` should read
  `clean_worktree_ready_if_other_gates_green`.
- `results/release_preflight_checklist_audit/summary.json` should read
  `docs_and_audits_green`.
- `results/P10_submission_archive_ready/summary.json` should read
  `archive_ready`.
- The default downstream lane is `explicit_archive_stop_or_hygiene_only`.

Please in plan mode:

1. Start from the landed
   `H65_post_p66_p67_p68_archive_first_terminal_freeze_packet +
   P69_post_h65_repo_graph_hygiene_inventory +
   P70_post_p69_archive_index_and_artifact_policy_sync +
   P71_post_p70_clean_descendant_merge_prep_readiness_sync +
   P66_post_p65_successor_publication_review +
   P67_post_p66_published_successor_freeze +
   P68_post_p67_release_hygiene_and_control_rebaseline +
   P56_post_h64_clean_merge_candidate_packet +
   P57_post_h64_paper_submission_package_sync +
   P58_post_h64_archive_release_closeout_sync +
   P59_post_h64_control_and_handoff_sync` state.
2. Recommend one main next route first: explicit stop, archive polish,
   later clean-descendant merge-prep planning, or no further action.
3. Do not reopen same-lane executor-value work, runtime authorization, broad
   Wasm, arbitrary `C`, transformed/trainable entry, or dirty-root integration.
4. Only discuss `R63` if it stays strictly non-runtime and materially differs
   from the closed `R62/H58` lane on useful target, comparator, cost share,
   query:insert ratio, tie burden, and cost model.
5. Write the next phase as explicit waves with objective, inputs, outputs,
   stop conditions, go/no-go, expected commits, and whether a new worktree or
   subagent is needed.
