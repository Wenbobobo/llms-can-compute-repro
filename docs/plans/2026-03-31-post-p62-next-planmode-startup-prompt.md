# Post-P62 Next Plan-Mode Startup Prompt

Current locked facts:

- The active docs-only packet is
  `H64_post_p53_p54_p55_f38_archive_first_freeze_packet`.
- The landed earlier follow-through stack is
  `P56_post_h64_clean_merge_candidate_packet`,
  `P57_post_h64_paper_submission_package_sync`,
  `P58_post_h64_archive_release_closeout_sync`,
  `P59_post_h64_control_and_handoff_sync`.
- The current published clean-descendant stack is
  `P60_post_p59_published_clean_descendant_promotion_prep`,
  `P61_post_p60_release_hygiene_rebaseline`,
  `P62_post_p61_merge_prep_control_sync`.
- The current published clean-descendant branch is
  `wip/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep`.
- The current local hygiene successor branch is
  `wip/p63-post-p62-tight-core-hygiene`.
- The current docs router is `docs/README.md`.
- The current branch/worktree registry is
  `docs/branch_worktree_registry.md`.
- The preserved local integration base is `wip/p56-main-scratch`.
- Dirty root `main` remains quarantine-only.
- Merge posture remains `clean_descendant_only_never_dirty_root_main`.
- Runtime remains closed.
- `F38` / `R63` remain dormant and non-runtime only.
- `F38` keeps comparator, cost share, query:insert ratio, tie burden, and
  material cost delta versus `R62/H58` unresolved.
- The default downstream lane remains `archive_or_hygiene_stop`.
- `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` should read
  `clean_worktree_ready_if_other_gates_green`.
- `results/release_preflight_checklist_audit/summary.json` should read
  `docs_and_audits_green`.
- `results/P10_submission_archive_ready/summary.json` should read
  `archive_ready`.

Please in plan mode:

1. Start from the landed
   `H64_post_p53_p54_p55_f38_archive_first_freeze_packet +
   P56_post_h64_clean_merge_candidate_packet +
   P57_post_h64_paper_submission_package_sync +
   P58_post_h64_archive_release_closeout_sync +
   P59_post_h64_control_and_handoff_sync +
   P60_post_p59_published_clean_descendant_promotion_prep +
   P61_post_p60_release_hygiene_rebaseline +
   P62_post_p61_merge_prep_control_sync` state.
2. Recommend one main next route first: tight-core cleanup completion,
   merge-prep follow-through, explicit promotion-prep, archive polish,
   explicit stop, or no further action.
3. Do not reopen same-lane executor-value work, runtime authorization, broad
   Wasm, arbitrary `C`, transformed/trainable entry, or dirty-root integration.
4. Only discuss `R63` if it stays strictly non-runtime and materially differs
   from the closed `R62/H58` lane on useful target, comparator, cost share,
   query:insert ratio, tie burden, and cost model.
5. Write the next phase as explicit waves with objective, inputs, outputs,
   stop conditions, go/no-go, expected commits, and whether a new worktree or
   subagent is needed.
