# 2026-04-01 Post-P71 Next Plan-Mode Handoff

## Purpose

Shortest safe entrypoint after the `H65` terminal-freeze packet and the
`P69/P70/P71` hygiene-only cleanup stack land without reopening science.

## Current Locked State

- active docs-only packet:
  `H65_post_p66_p67_p68_archive_first_terminal_freeze_packet`
- current hygiene-only cleanup stack:
  `P69_post_h65_repo_graph_hygiene_inventory`,
  `P70_post_p69_archive_index_and_artifact_policy_sync`,
  `P71_post_p70_clean_descendant_merge_prep_readiness_sync`
- current frozen successor stack:
  `P66_post_p65_successor_publication_review`,
  `P67_post_p66_published_successor_freeze`,
  `P68_post_p67_release_hygiene_and_control_rebaseline`
- landed earlier follow-through stack:
  `P56_post_h64_clean_merge_candidate_packet`,
  `P57_post_h64_paper_submission_package_sync`,
  `P58_post_h64_archive_release_closeout_sync`,
  `P59_post_h64_control_and_handoff_sync`
- current dormant future dossier:
  `F38_post_h62_r63_dormant_eligibility_profile_dossier`

## Branch And Merge Posture

- current hygiene-only cleanup branch:
  `wip/p69-post-h65-hygiene-only-cleanup`
- current published clean-descendant branch:
  `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze`
- preserved local integration base:
  `wip/p56-main-scratch`
- `wip/p56-main-scratch...wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze = 0/17`
- `origin/main...wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze = 0/158`
- the read-only `git merge-tree` probe between `wip/p56-main-scratch` and
  `wip/p66-post-p65-published-successor-freeze` records no content-conflict
  markers
- dirty root repo remains parked as `wip/root-main-parking-2026-03-24`
- merge posture remains `clean_descendant_only_never_dirty_root_main`
- merge execution into `main` remains absent

## Default Recommendation

- prefer explicit stop, archive polish, or no further action over speculative
  science
- keep `R63` dormant unless a later explicit non-runtime packet resolves the
  target, comparator, and cost-profile fields honestly
- if any later merge-prep is discussed, start from `wip/p56-main-scratch`, not
  dirty root `main`
