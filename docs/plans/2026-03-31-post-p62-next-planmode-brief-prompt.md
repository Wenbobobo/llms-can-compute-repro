# Post-P62 Brief Plan-Mode Prompt

Current locked facts:

- Active docs-only packet: `H64_post_p53_p54_p55_f38_archive_first_freeze_packet`.
- Landed earlier follow-through stack: `P56`, `P57`, `P58`, `P59`.
- Current published clean-descendant stack: `P60`, `P61`, `P62`.
- Current published clean-descendant branch: `wip/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep`.
- Current published clean-descendant upstream: `origin/wip/p60-post-p59-published-clean-descendant-prep`.
- Dirty root `main` remains quarantine-only.
- Merge posture remains `clean_descendant_only_never_dirty_root_main`.
- Runtime remains closed.
- `F38` / `R63` remain dormant and non-runtime only.
- `release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot = clean_worktree_ready_if_other_gates_green`.
- `release_preflight_checklist_audit = docs_and_audits_green`.
- `P10_submission_archive_ready = archive_ready`.
- Default downstream lane remains `archive_or_hygiene_stop`.

Please in plan mode:

1. Recommend one main next route first: review packaging, merge-prep/promotion-prep,
   archive polish, explicit stop, or no further action.
2. Do not reopen same-lane executor-value work, runtime authorization, broad
   Wasm, arbitrary `C`, transformed/trainable entry, or dirty-root integration.
3. Only discuss `R63` if it stays strictly non-runtime and materially differs
   from the closed `R62/H58` lane.
4. Write the next phase as explicit waves with objective, inputs, outputs,
   stop conditions, go/no-go, expected commits, and whether a new worktree or
   subagent is needed.
