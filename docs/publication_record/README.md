# Publication Record

This directory is the paper-first evidence ledger for the repository. Formal
paper text is still evolving, but claim wording, figure/table ownership,
bundle boundaries, and public-safe evidence mapping should be treated as active
rather than speculative.

Current control docs:
- `current_stage_driver.md` — the canonical `active_driver` for the current
  `H32` active routing/refreeze packet, preserving `H27` as the negative
  closeout of the old same-endpoint wave, `H28` as the Origin-core pivot
  packet, `H29/R36/R37/H30/H31/R38` as the frozen upstream evidence chain, the
  older same-endpoint `H25/H23` stack as preserved historical context, and any
  later compiler-boundary extension as conditional on a new plan packet;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-22-post-h30-h31-r38-extension-plan.md` — the current
  saved post-`H30` execution surface for the explicit later decision packet,
  one richer same-substrate extension gate, `H32` refreeze, and `P18` clean
  closeout;
- `docs/milestones/P18_post_h32_clean_worktree_promotion/` — the current clean
  worktree closeout lane that fixes packet split and runbook after `H32`;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-22-post-r36-explicit-next-wave-design.md` — the
  preserved historical pre-execution planning packet that defined the narrow
  `R37 -> H30` route before execution;
- `docs/plans/README.md` — navigation index for the current unattended master
  plan, the current `H31/R38/H32/P18` design packet, and the historical design
  stack;
- `docs/milestones/README.md` — navigation index for the current active/frozen
  milestones, deferred next lanes, blocked/planning-only bundles, and
  preserved historical packets;

  active/preserved Origin-core pivot packet, primitive gate, execution gate,
  upstream refreeze, narrow precision-boundary follow-up, tiny compiled-boundary
  gate, explicit later decision packet, richer compiled control-surface gate,
  and current refreeze packet;

- `results/H18_post_h17_mainline_reopen_guard/summary.json` — machine-readable
  planning guard confirming that the post-`H17` same-scope reopen is ready
  without changing the frozen-evidence state;
- `results/R19_d0_pointer_like_surface_generalization_gate/summary.json` — the
  landed `R19` runtime gate, carrying the admitted-plus-heldout
  exactness/runtime verdict for the first same-endpoint generalization batch;
- `results/R20_d0_runtime_mechanism_ablation_matrix/summary.json` — the
  landed `R20` mechanism lane, showing that the fixed same-endpoint
  pointer-like path stayed exact while the bounded negative controls failed;
- `results/R21_d0_exact_executor_boundary_break_map/summary.json` — the

  exact on every executed candidate and did not yet localize a failure inside
  that scan;
- `H18` / `R19` / `R20` / `R21` / `H19` now define the preserved earlier
  same-endpoint reopen/refreeze packet, `H20` / `R22` / `R23` / `H21` define
  the preserved immediate pre-reopen control packet, `H22` / `R26` / `R28` /
  conditional `R27` / `H23` define the preserved bounded reopen/refreeze
  packet on the old same-endpoint route, `H17` is the preserved prior
  same-scope refreeze, `H15` is the completed predecessor refreeze stage, and
  `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed prior reopen packet;
- `planning_state_taxonomy.md` — allowed planning-state labels and current
  assignments for active drivers, standing gates, dormant protocols, and
  historical-complete references;
- `paper_package_plan.md` — completed post-`P7` stage design retained as a
  `historical_complete` reference;
- `release_candidate_checklist.md` — restrained outward-sync
  `standing_gate` for the locked checkpoint;
- `conditional_reopen_protocol.md` — bounded reopen protocol still governing
  the current bounded `D0` packet; `E1c` remains conditional only.

Completed baselines:
- `H14` / `R11` / `R12` / `H15` remain the completed bounded core-first
  reopen/refreeze packet on the same endpoint; `R11` keeps geometry parity
  exact while blocking same-endpoint speedup wording, `R12` keeps current
  executor exports exact while making the harder-slice inventory explicit, and
  `H15` leaves `R13` inactive plus `R14` unjustified on current evidence;
- `R15` remains the first landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it complements
  rather than replaces `R8` by covering the four `R6` families that were still
  missing retrieval-pressure evidence;
- `R16` remains the second landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it saturates
  the admitted `R8/R15` memory-surface precision follow-up without widening
  endpoint scope and hands the current packet forward to `R17`;
- `R17` remains the third landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it closes the
  full admitted runtime surface with a negative bridge result, keeps `0`
  contradiction candidates, and names one bounded `R18` target on
  `helper_checkpoint_braid_long/retrieval_total`;
- `R18` now remains the completed comparator-only runtime repair packet under
  `H16`; `R18a` failed its narrow decomp-first gate, but `R18b` closed the
  same-surface packet with exact focused probes and exact `8/8` confirmation,
  so `R18c` was not needed;
- `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed bounded long-horizon direct
  baseline on the same endpoint; `R7` preserves the full admitted family set
  but only profiles the top `4` heaviest representatives in its bounded
  runtime stop result;
- `H6` / `R3` / `R4` / inactive `R5` / `H7` remain the completed bounded
  exactness/mechanism baseline underneath the current packet;
- `H4` / `E1a` / `E1b` / `H5` remain the completed bounded return packet that
  sharpened precision and same-scope systems wording without widening scope;
- `H3` / `P10` / `P11` / `F1` remain the completed control baseline that made
  the locked checkpoint auditable and handoff-safe before the active return
  packets resumed reproduction work.

Operating rule:
- every unattended batch that changes a claim boundary, a milestone gate, or a
  future figure/table dependency must update these ledgers in the same batch;
- exactly one document set should act as the current `active_driver`, and that
  role currently belongs to `current_stage_driver.md`;
- the next operational wave may be planned in detail before it lands, but
  planned work must stay clearly separated from frozen evidence;
- future short public-surface syncs should derive from
  `release_summary_draft.md`, while the manuscript bundle remains the
  authoritative paper-facing source;
- planning guards such as `H18`, `H20`, and `H22` may guide unattended
  execution before new runtime evidence lands, but once runtime exports such
  as `R19`, `R20`, `R21`, `R22`, `R23`, `R26`, `R27`, and `R28` exist they
  must be recorded explicitly and then frozen by a later closeout such as
  `H19`, `H21`, or `H23` before outward wording moves downstream;
- derivative writing aids remain downstream-only and must not outrun the locked
  manuscript bundle;
- appendix-level diagnostics that strengthen an existing claim row without
  widening scope should stay tied to that claim and the `P1` paper bundle,
  rather than becoming a new claim layer by default;
- the current frozen state preserves `H8/R6/R7/H9` as the completed direct
  baseline, preserves `H6/R3/R4/(inactive R5)/H7` as the deeper historical
  baseline, preserves `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` as the latest earlier
  same-endpoint follow-up packet, preserves `H13/V1` as the completed
  governance/runtime handoff, preserves `H14/R11/R12/H15` as the completed
  reopen/refreeze packet, preserves `H16/R15/R16/R17/R18/H17` as the completed
  prior same-scope reopen/refreeze packet, preserves
  `H18/R19/R20/R21/H19` as the earlier same-endpoint refreeze packet,
  preserves `H20/R22/R23/H21` as the immediate pre-reopen control packet,
  keeps `H23` as the preserved prior same-endpoint frozen state, keeps `H21` as the
  preserved prior control, keeps `H19` as the preserved earlier same-endpoint
  refreeze decision, keeps `H17` as the preserved prior same-scope refreeze
  decision, keeps `H15` as the preserved prior refreeze decision, uses the
  bounded timing follow-up as the current operational reference for full-suite
  runtime behavior, and leaves `E1c` dormant unless a completed packet or
  later explicit review exposes a true `D0` contradiction;
- short-form alignment for guards: `H32` is the current active routing/refreeze
  packet, `H31` and `H30` are preserved upstream decision packets, `H29` is
  the preserved upstream Origin-core refreeze, `R38` is the preserved richer
  control-surface gate, `R37` is the preserved tiny compiled-boundary gate,
  `R36` is the preserved precision follow-up, `H27` is the preserved
  same-endpoint closeout, `H25` is the
  preserved prior active decision packet, `H23` is the preserved frozen
  same-endpoint scientific state, `P14` remains the completed downstream
  docs-only outward-sync lane, `H24` remains the completed
  post-`H23` split stage, `R30` and `R31` remain the landed post-`H23`
  decision packets, `R32` remains the authorized next science lane, `R33`
  remains the deferred systems-audit lane, `H22` remains the completed bounded
  reopen-control stage,
  `H21` remains the preserved immediate pre-reopen control,
  `H20` remains the completed reentry-and-hygiene split guard,
  `H19` remains the preserved earlier same-endpoint refreeze stage,
  `H18` remains the completed same-endpoint reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `H17` remains the preserved prior same-scope refreeze stage,
  `H16` remains the completed earlier same-scope reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `R19` remains the landed admitted-plus-heldout runtime generalization lane,
  `R20` remains the landed mechanism lane, `R21` remains the landed bounded
  executor-boundary lane, `R22` remains the landed harder boundary follow-up
  underneath `H21`, `R23` remains the landed same-endpoint systems follow-up
  underneath `H21`, `R26` remains the landed first-wave boundary scan, `R28`
  remains the landed mechanism-contract audit, `R27` remains the landed bounded
  second-wave extension, `R18` remains the completed comparator-only repair
  closeout, `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed prior reopen packet,
  `H13` / `V1` remain the completed governance/runtime handoff,
  `H10` / `H11` / `R8` / `R9` / `R10` / `H12` remain the latest older
  same-endpoint packet, and `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed
  bounded long-horizon direct baseline;
- `blog_outline.md` remains downstream and currently blocked: `M7` resolved as
  a no-widening decision, so broader blog prose should not outrun the present
  paper-grade endpoint.
