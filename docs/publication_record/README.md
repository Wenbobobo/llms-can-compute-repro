# Publication Record

This directory is the paper-first evidence ledger for the repository. Formal
paper text is still evolving, but claim wording, figure/table ownership,
bundle boundaries, and public-safe evidence mapping should be treated as active
rather than speculative.

Current control docs:
- `current_stage_driver.md` — the canonical `active_driver` for the current
  `H21` frozen same-endpoint state, with the completed `H20/R22/R23`
  follow-up packet preserved underneath it, `H19` preserved as the immediate
  pre-refreeze control, `H17` preserved as the prior same-scope refreeze,
  `H15` preserved as the prior refreeze-and-decision-sync stage,
  `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` preserved as the latest earlier same-endpoint
  follow-up packet, `H13/V1` preserved as the governance/runtime handoff, and
  future frontier work left conditional on a new explicit plan;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-21-post-r22-r23-h21-mainline-design.md` — the current
  execution plan for conservative post-`H21` closeout, with the `P12` closeout
  now preserved, `R24/R25` kept planning-only, `P13` kept downstream-only, and
  `F2` still planning-only;
- `docs/milestones/R24_d0_boundary_localization_zoom_followup/` and
  `docs/milestones/R25_d0_same_endpoint_systems_recovery_hypotheses/` — the
  current planning-only pre-next-phase packet, keeping boundary-first reopen
  scoping and same-endpoint systems hypotheses explicit without authorizing new
  execution;
- `results/H21_refreeze_after_r22_r23/summary.json` — machine-readable
  refreeze for the post-`R22/R23` same-endpoint packet, including the current
  `supported_here` / `unsupported_here` / `disconfirmed_here` partition and
  the downstream `P12` handoff that has now been closed out in docs;
- `results/H20_post_h19_mainline_reentry_and_hygiene_split/summary.json` —
  machine-readable reentry guard for the `H19 -> R22/R23/H21` handoff;
- `results/H18_post_h17_mainline_reopen_guard/summary.json` — machine-readable
  planning guard confirming that the post-`H17` same-scope reopen is ready
  without changing the frozen-evidence state;
- `results/R19_d0_pointer_like_surface_generalization_gate/summary.json` — the
  landed `R19` runtime gate, carrying the admitted-plus-heldout
  exactness/runtime verdict for the first same-endpoint generalization batch;
- `results/R20_d0_runtime_mechanism_ablation_matrix/summary.json` — the
  landed `R20` mechanism lane, showing that the fixed same-endpoint
  pointer-like path stayed exact while the bounded negative controls failed;
- `results/R21_d0_exact_executor_boundary_break_map/summary.json` — the
  landed `R21` boundary scan, showing that the bounded executor grid stayed
  exact on every executed candidate and did not yet localize a failure inside
  that scan;
- `H18` / `R19` / `R20` / `R21` / `H19` now define the preserved
  pre-`R22/R23` same-endpoint reopen/refreeze packet, `H20` / `R22` / `R23` /
  `H21` define the current follow-up packet, `H17` is the preserved prior
  same-scope refreeze, `H15` is the completed predecessor refreeze stage, and
  `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed prior reopen packet;
- `planning_state_taxonomy.md` — allowed planning-state labels and current
  assignments for active drivers, standing gates, dormant protocols, and
  historical-complete references;
- `paper_package_plan.md` — completed post-`P7` stage design retained as a
  `historical_complete` reference;
- `release_candidate_checklist.md` — restrained outward-sync
  `standing_gate` for the locked checkpoint;
- `conditional_reopen_protocol.md` — bounded reopen protocol still governing
  the current bounded `D0` packet; `E1c` remains conditional only.

Completed baselines:
- `H14` / `R11` / `R12` / `H15` remain the completed bounded core-first
  reopen/refreeze packet on the same endpoint; `R11` keeps geometry parity
  exact while blocking same-endpoint speedup wording, `R12` keeps current
  executor exports exact while making the harder-slice inventory explicit, and
  `H15` leaves `R13` inactive plus `R14` unjustified on current evidence;
- `R15` remains the first landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it complements
  rather than replaces `R8` by covering the four `R6` families that were still
  missing retrieval-pressure evidence;
- `R16` remains the second landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it saturates
  the admitted `R8/R15` memory-surface precision follow-up without widening
  endpoint scope and hands the current packet forward to `R17`;
- `R17` remains the third landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it closes the
  full admitted runtime surface with a negative bridge result, keeps `0`
  contradiction candidates, and names one bounded `R18` target on
  `helper_checkpoint_braid_long/retrieval_total`;
- `R18` now remains the completed comparator-only runtime repair packet under
  `H16`; `R18a` failed its narrow decomp-first gate, but `R18b` closed the
  same-surface packet with exact focused probes and exact `8/8` confirmation,
  so `R18c` was not needed;
- `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed bounded long-horizon direct
  baseline on the same endpoint; `R7` preserves the full admitted family set
  but only profiles the top `4` heaviest representatives in its bounded
  runtime stop result;
- `H6` / `R3` / `R4` / inactive `R5` / `H7` remain the completed bounded
  exactness/mechanism baseline underneath the current packet;
- `H4` / `E1a` / `E1b` / `H5` remain the completed bounded return packet that
  sharpened precision and same-scope systems wording without widening scope;
- `H3` / `P10` / `P11` / `F1` remain the completed control baseline that made
  the locked checkpoint auditable and handoff-safe before the active return
  packets resumed reproduction work.

  protocol, used only if the current bounded `D0` packet exposes a `D0`
  contradiction.

Supporting references:

  STATUS / release summary and paper-facing ledgers; now paired with the
  machine-readable `release_preflight_checklist_audit` export;

  the evidence stabilizes.

Operating rule:
- every unattended batch that changes a claim boundary, a milestone gate, or a
  future figure/table dependency must update these ledgers in the same batch;
- exactly one document set should act as the current `active_driver`, and that
  role currently belongs to `current_stage_driver.md`;
- the next operational wave may be planned in detail before it lands, but
  planned work must stay clearly separated from frozen evidence;
- future short public-surface syncs should derive from
  `release_summary_draft.md`, while the manuscript bundle remains the
  authoritative paper-facing source;
- planning guards such as `H18` and `H20` may guide unattended execution
  before new runtime evidence lands, but once runtime exports such as `R19`,
  `R20`, `R21`, `R22`, and `R23` exist they must be recorded explicitly and
  then frozen by a later closeout such as `H19` or `H21` before outward
  wording moves downstream;
- derivative writing aids remain downstream-only and must not outrun the locked
  manuscript bundle;
- appendix-level diagnostics that strengthen an existing claim row without
  widening scope should stay tied to that claim and the `P1` paper bundle,
  rather than becoming a new claim layer by default;
- the current frozen state preserves `H8/R6/R7/H9` as the completed direct baseline,
  preserves `H6/R3/R4/(inactive R5)/H7` as the deeper historical baseline,
  preserves `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` as the latest earlier same-endpoint
  follow-up packet, preserves `H13/V1` as the completed governance/runtime
  handoff, preserves `H14/R11/R12/H15` as the completed reopen/refreeze
  packet, preserves `H16/R15/R16/R17/R18/H17` as the completed prior
  same-scope reopen/refreeze packet, preserves `H18/R19/R20/R21/H19` as the
  completed immediate pre-refreeze mainline packet, keeps `H21` as the current
  frozen same-endpoint state, keeps `H19` as the preserved prior same-endpoint
  refreeze decision, keeps `H17` as the preserved prior same-scope
  refreeze decision, keeps `H15` as the preserved prior refreeze decision,
  uses the bounded timing follow-up as the current operational reference for
  full-suite runtime behavior, and leaves `E1c` dormant unless a completed
  packet or later explicit review exposes a true `D0` contradiction;
- short-form alignment for guards: `H21` is the current frozen driver state,
  `H20` remains the completed reentry-and-hygiene split guard,
  `H19` remains the preserved prior same-endpoint refreeze stage,
  `H18` remains the completed same-endpoint reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `H17` remains the preserved prior same-scope refreeze stage,
  `H16` remains the completed earlier same-scope reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `R19` remains the landed admitted-plus-heldout runtime generalization lane,
  `R20` remains the landed mechanism lane, `R21` remains the landed bounded
  executor-boundary lane, `R22` remains the landed harder boundary follow-up,
  `R23` remains the landed same-endpoint systems follow-up, `R18` remains the completed comparator-only repair
  closeout, `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed prior reopen packet,
  `H13` / `V1` remain the completed governance/runtime handoff,
  `H10` / `H11` / `R8` / `R9` / `R10` / `H12` remain the latest older
  same-endpoint packet, and `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed
  bounded long-horizon direct baseline;
- `blog_outline.md` remains downstream and currently blocked: `M7` resolved as
  a no-widening decision, so broader blog prose should not outrun the present
  paper-grade endpoint.
