# Publication Record

This directory is the paper-first evidence ledger for the repository. Formal
paper text is still evolving, but claim wording, figure/table ownership,
bundle boundaries, and public-safe evidence mapping should be treated as active
rather than speculative.

Current control docs:
- `current_stage_driver.md` — the canonical `active_driver` for the current
  `H25` active decision packet, preserving `H23` as the current frozen
  same-endpoint scientific state, preserving the completed `H22/R26/R28/R27`
  bounded reopen packet underneath it, `H21` as the immediate pre-reopen
  control, `H19` as the earlier same-endpoint refreeze control, `H17` as the
  prior same-scope refreeze, `H15` as the prior refreeze-and-decision-sync stage,
  `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` preserved as the latest earlier same-endpoint
  follow-up packet, `H13/V1` preserved as the governance/runtime handoff, and
  future frontier work left conditional on a new explicit plan;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-22-post-h23-reauthorization-design.md` — the current
  execution plan that landed `H24/R30/R31/H25`, preserves `H23` as the frozen
  scientific state, stages `R32` as the primary future lane, keeps `R33`
  deferred, leaves `R29` and `F3` blocked, and leaves `F2` planning-only;
- `docs/plans/README.md` — navigation index for the current unattended master
  plan, the active post-`H23` / post-`H25` design pair, and the historical
  design stack;
- `docs/milestones/README.md` — navigation index for the current active/frozen
  milestones, deferred next lanes, blocked/planning-only bundles, and
  preserved historical packets;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-22-post-h25-r32-r33-near-term-design.md` — the current
  near-term downstream handoff that keeps `R32` as the first justified next
  science lane, keeps `R33` deferred as an attribution-first prerequisite
  lane, and records that new runtime execution should wait for a clean
  next-stage worktree or later explicit activation packet;
- `docs/plans/2026-03-22-post-unattended-r32-mainline-design.md` — the current
  next-stage design that adds `P16` as the immediate clean-worktree closeout
  lane ahead of execution, then records the intended `R32 -> H26 -> conditional
  R33 -> H27` sequence without changing the frozen scientific scope;
- `docs/milestones/H25_refreeze_after_r30_r31_decision_packet/`,
  `docs/milestones/P16_h25_commit_hygiene_and_clean_worktree_promotion/`,

  `docs/milestones/H27_refreeze_after_r32_r33_same_endpoint_decision/`,
  `docs/milestones/R29_d0_same_endpoint_systems_recovery_execution_gate/`, and
  `docs/milestones/F3_post_h23_scope_lift_decision_bundle/` — the current
  active decision packet, the immediate closeout lane, the
  authorized/deferred future lanes, the planned downstream refreeze packets,
  and the blocked future execution/scope-lift packet, kept explicit without
  authorizing scope widening;
- `docs/milestones/F2_future_frontier_recheck_activation_matrix/` and
  `docs/milestones/F4_post_h23_origin_claim_delta_matrix/` — internal-only
  planning surfaces that keep future frontier review gated and origin-facing
  claim comparisons anchored to the frozen `H23` evidence while staying
  operationally downstream of `H25`;
- `docs/milestones/P15_internal_claim_and_handoff_sync_after_h25/` — the
  current internal handoff surface for blocked frontier/scope-lift paths,
  unattended continuation, and commit-hygiene split guidance without creating a
  new runtime lane;
- `results/H25_refreeze_after_r30_r31_decision_packet/summary.json` —
  machine-readable refreeze for the post-`H23` decision packet, including the
  current primary next lane, deferred audit lane, and preserved blockers;
- `docs/milestones/R32_d0_family_local_boundary_sharp_zoom/execution_manifest.md`
  — planning-only first-pass `R32` manifest fixing the candidate core,
  ceiling-relative zoom ladder, stop rules, and required outputs before any
  execution batch;
- `docs/milestones/R33_d0_non_retrieval_overhead_localization_audit/component_localization_manifest.md`
  — planning-only first-pass `R33` manifest fixing the comparator set,
  stratified audit packet, escalation rule, component targets, and required
  outputs before any execution batch;
- `docs/milestones/F2_future_frontier_recheck_activation_matrix/activation_matrix.md`,
  `docs/milestones/F3_post_h23_scope_lift_decision_bundle/decision_gate.md`,
  `docs/milestones/F4_post_h23_origin_claim_delta_matrix/claim_delta_matrix.md`,
  and
  `docs/milestones/P15_internal_claim_and_handoff_sync_after_h25/handoff_notes.md`
  — the smallest current bundle for understanding blocked frontier/scope-lift
  conditions, origin-facing claim deltas, and unattended handoff state without
  rereading the full repo history;
- `results/H23_refreeze_after_r26_r27_r28/summary.json` — machine-readable
  refreeze for the post-`H22/R26/R28/R27` same-endpoint packet, including the
  current scientific `supported_here` / `unsupported_here` /
  `disconfirmed_here` partition and the downstream `P14` handoff;
- `results/R30_d0_boundary_reauthorization_packet/summary.json` — the landed
  post-`H23` boundary reauthorization packet;
- `results/R31_d0_same_endpoint_systems_recovery_reauthorization_packet/summary.json`
  — the landed post-`H23` systems reauthorization packet;
- `results/H22_post_h21_boundary_reopen_and_dual_track_lock/summary.json` —
  machine-readable reopen-control packet for the bounded post-`H21` follow-up;
- `results/R26_d0_boundary_localization_execution_gate/summary.json` —
  machine-readable first-wave boundary scan for the bounded reopen packet;
- `results/R27_d0_boundary_localization_extension_gate/summary.json` —
  machine-readable conditional extension showing that the bounded second wave
  still did not localize a failure;
- `results/R28_d0_trace_retrieval_contract_audit/summary.json` —
  machine-readable mechanism-contract audit showing support with partial
  control isolation;
- `results/H21_refreeze_after_r22_r23/summary.json` — machine-readable
  preserved pre-reopen control for the post-`R22/R23` same-endpoint packet;
- `results/H20_post_h19_mainline_reentry_and_hygiene_split/summary.json` —
  machine-readable reentry guard for the `H19 -> R22/R23/H21` handoff;
- `results/H18_post_h17_mainline_reopen_guard/summary.json` — machine-readable
  planning guard confirming that the post-`H17` same-scope reopen is ready
  without changing the frozen-evidence state;
- `results/R19_d0_pointer_like_surface_generalization_gate/summary.json` — the
  landed `R19` runtime gate, carrying the admitted-plus-heldout
  exactness/runtime verdict for the first same-endpoint generalization batch;
- `results/R20_d0_runtime_mechanism_ablation_matrix/summary.json` — the
  landed `R20` mechanism lane, showing that the fixed same-endpoint
  pointer-like path stayed exact while the bounded negative controls failed;
- `results/R21_d0_exact_executor_boundary_break_map/summary.json` — the
  landed `R21` boundary scan, showing that the bounded executor grid stayed
  exact on every executed candidate and did not yet localize a failure inside
  that scan;
- `H18` / `R19` / `R20` / `R21` / `H19` now define the preserved earlier
  same-endpoint reopen/refreeze packet, `H20` / `R22` / `R23` / `H21` define
  the preserved immediate pre-reopen control packet, `H22` / `R26` / `R28` /
  conditional `R27` / `H23` define the current bounded reopen/refreeze packet,
  `H17` is the preserved prior same-scope refreeze, `H15` is the completed
  predecessor refreeze stage, and `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed
  prior reopen packet;
- `planning_state_taxonomy.md` — allowed planning-state labels and current
  assignments for active drivers, standing gates, dormant protocols, and
  historical-complete references;
- `paper_package_plan.md` — completed post-`P7` stage design retained as a
  `historical_complete` reference;
- `release_candidate_checklist.md` — restrained outward-sync
  `standing_gate` for the locked checkpoint;
- `conditional_reopen_protocol.md` — bounded reopen protocol still governing
  the current bounded `D0` packet; `E1c` remains conditional only.

Completed baselines:
- `H14` / `R11` / `R12` / `H15` remain the completed bounded core-first
  reopen/refreeze packet on the same endpoint; `R11` keeps geometry parity
  exact while blocking same-endpoint speedup wording, `R12` keeps current
  executor exports exact while making the harder-slice inventory explicit, and
  `H15` leaves `R13` inactive plus `R14` unjustified on current evidence;
- `R15` remains the first landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it complements
  rather than replaces `R8` by covering the four `R6` families that were still
  missing retrieval-pressure evidence;
- `R16` remains the second landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it saturates
  the admitted `R8/R15` memory-surface precision follow-up without widening
  endpoint scope and hands the current packet forward to `R17`;
- `R17` remains the third landed same-scope lane under `H16`; it closes the
  full admitted runtime surface with a negative bridge result, keeps `0`
  contradiction candidates, and names one bounded `R18` target on
  `helper_checkpoint_braid_long/retrieval_total`;
- `R18` now remains the completed comparator-only runtime repair packet under
  `H16`; `R18a` failed its narrow decomp-first gate, but `R18b` closed the
  same-surface packet with exact focused probes and exact `8/8` confirmation,
  so `R18c` was not needed;
- `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed bounded long-horizon direct
  baseline on the same endpoint; `R7` preserves the full admitted family set
  but only profiles the top `4` heaviest representatives in its bounded
  runtime stop result;
- `H6` / `R3` / `R4` / inactive `R5` / `H7` remain the completed bounded
  exactness/mechanism baseline underneath the current packet;
- `H4` / `E1a` / `E1b` / `H5` remain the completed bounded return packet that
  sharpened precision and same-scope systems wording without widening scope;
- `H3` / `P10` / `P11` / `F1` remain the completed control baseline that made
  the locked checkpoint auditable and handoff-safe before the active return
  packets resumed reproduction work.

Operating rule:
- every unattended batch that changes a claim boundary, a milestone gate, or a
  future figure/table dependency must update these ledgers in the same batch;
- exactly one document set should act as the current `active_driver`, and that
  role currently belongs to `current_stage_driver.md`;
- the next operational wave may be planned in detail before it lands, but
  planned work must stay clearly separated from frozen evidence;
- future short public-surface syncs should derive from
  `release_summary_draft.md`, while the manuscript bundle remains the
  authoritative paper-facing source;
- planning guards such as `H18`, `H20`, and `H22` may guide unattended
  execution before new runtime evidence lands, but once runtime exports such
  as `R19`, `R20`, `R21`, `R22`, `R23`, `R26`, `R27`, and `R28` exist they
  must be recorded explicitly and then frozen by a later closeout such as
  `H19`, `H21`, or `H23` before outward wording moves downstream;
- derivative writing aids remain downstream-only and must not outrun the locked
  manuscript bundle;
- appendix-level diagnostics that strengthen an existing claim row without
  widening scope should stay tied to that claim and the `P1` paper bundle,
  rather than becoming a new claim layer by default;
- the current frozen state preserves `H8/R6/R7/H9` as the completed direct
  baseline, preserves `H6/R3/R4/(inactive R5)/H7` as the deeper historical
  baseline, preserves `H10/H11/R8/R9/R10/H12` as the latest earlier
  same-endpoint follow-up packet, preserves `H13/V1` as the completed
  governance/runtime handoff, preserves `H14/R11/R12/H15` as the completed
  reopen/refreeze packet, preserves `H16/R15/R16/R17/R18/H17` as the completed
  prior same-scope reopen/refreeze packet, preserves
  `H18/R19/R20/R21/H19` as the earlier same-endpoint refreeze packet,
  preserves `H20/R22/R23/H21` as the immediate pre-reopen control packet,
  keeps `H23` as the current frozen same-endpoint state, keeps `H21` as the
  preserved prior control, keeps `H19` as the preserved earlier same-endpoint
  refreeze decision, keeps `H17` as the preserved prior same-scope refreeze
  decision, keeps `H15` as the preserved prior refreeze decision, uses the
  bounded timing follow-up as the current operational reference for full-suite
  runtime behavior, and leaves `E1c` dormant unless a completed packet or
  later explicit review exposes a true `D0` contradiction;
- short-form alignment for guards: `H25` is the current active decision packet,
  `H23` is the current frozen scientific state, `P14` remains the completed
  downstream docs-only outward-sync lane, `H24` remains the completed
  post-`H23` split stage, `R30` and `R31` remain the landed post-`H23`
  decision packets, `R32` remains the authorized next science lane, `R33`
  remains the deferred systems-audit lane, `H22` remains the completed bounded
  reopen-control stage,
  `H21` remains the preserved immediate pre-reopen control,
  `H20` remains the completed reentry-and-hygiene split guard,
  `H19` remains the preserved earlier same-endpoint refreeze stage,
  `H18` remains the completed same-endpoint reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `H17` remains the preserved prior same-scope refreeze stage,
  `H16` remains the completed earlier same-scope reopen-and-scope-lock packet,
  `R19` remains the landed admitted-plus-heldout runtime generalization lane,
  `R20` remains the landed mechanism lane, `R21` remains the landed bounded
  executor-boundary lane, `R22` remains the landed harder boundary follow-up
  underneath `H21`, `R23` remains the landed same-endpoint systems follow-up
  underneath `H21`, `R26` remains the landed first-wave boundary scan, `R28`
  remains the landed mechanism-contract audit, `R27` remains the landed bounded
  second-wave extension, `R18` remains the completed comparator-only repair
  closeout, `H14` / `R11` / `R12` remain the completed prior reopen packet,
  `H13` / `V1` remain the completed governance/runtime handoff,
  `H10` / `H11` / `R8` / `R9` / `R10` / `H12` remain the latest older
  same-endpoint packet, and `H8` / `R6` / `R7` / `H9` remain the completed
  bounded long-horizon direct baseline;
- `blog_outline.md` remains downstream and currently blocked: `M7` resolved as
  a no-widening decision, so broader blog prose should not outrun the present
  paper-grade endpoint.
