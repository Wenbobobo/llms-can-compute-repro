# Archival Repro Manifest

Status: archival manifest for the current locked checkpoint. This file records
what should be archived, how to regenerate core artifacts, and what must stay
out of the public bundle.

## Environment baseline

- Python `3.12`
- `uv` for environment and command orchestration
- current reproducibility summaries are generated from the repo-local virtual
  environment recorded in result JSON files
- CUDA is optional for archive readers; result bundles already record whether
  GPU support was present when exports ran

## Archive payload

- repository source under `src/`, `scripts/`, and `tests/`
- publication ledgers under `docs/publication_record/`
- milestone logs under `docs/milestones/`
- machine-readable outputs under `results/`
- top-level control surface: `README.md`, `STATUS.md`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `uv.lock`

## Integrity checks

- `results/P1_paper_readiness/summary.json` shows `10/10` ready figure/table
  items and no blocked or partial rows
- `results/H30_post_r36_r37_scope_decision_packet/summary.json` records the
  preserved prior Origin-core routing/refreeze packet after the tiny compiled
  boundary gate
- `results/H31_post_h30_later_explicit_boundary_decision_packet/summary.json`
  records the explicit later decision packet that fixed the admitted extension
  row and the boundary probe
- `results/R38_origin_compiler_control_surface_extension_gate/summary.json`
  records one richer same-substrate compiled control/call family
- `results/H32_post_r38_compiled_boundary_refreeze/summary.json` records the
  current active Origin-core routing/refreeze packet after the explicit
  extension and keeps any later compiler-boundary extension conditional on a
  new plan packet
- `results/H33_post_h32_conditional_next_question_packet/summary.json`
  records the preserved prior docs-only packet that selected exactly one
  same-substrate question while keeping `H32` active
- `results/R39_origin_compiler_control_surface_dependency_audit/summary.json`
  records one declared helper-body permutation with target renumbering
  surviving on the admitted row and the named same-family boundary probe
- `results/H34_post_r39_later_explicit_scope_decision_packet/summary.json`
  records the current docs-only freeze-complete-for-now packet above `H32`
  and the absence of any active downstream runtime lane
- `results/R37_origin_compiler_boundary_gate/summary.json` records one narrow
  positive fact beyond `H29/R36`: one admitted tiny bytecode subset survives
  source reference, lowering parity, and free-running exact execution on the
  active substrate
- `results/R36_origin_long_horizon_precision_scaling_gate/summary.json`
  records the active narrow precision boundary rather than a broad precision
  robustness claim
- `results/H29_refreeze_after_r34_r35_origin_core_gate/summary.json` records
  the preserved upstream Origin-core refreeze chain
- `results/H28_post_h27_origin_core_reanchor_packet/summary.json` records the
  Origin-core pivot away from the older same-endpoint route
- `results/H27_refreeze_after_r32_r33_same_endpoint_decision/summary.json`
  records the preserved negative closeout of the older same-endpoint route
- `results/H23_refreeze_after_r26_r27_r28/summary.json` records the preserved
  historical same-endpoint refreeze state, keeps the boundary unresolved inside the
  bounded `R22/R26/R27` envelope, keeps the mechanism contract positive only
  with partial control isolation, preserves the mixed systems verdict, and
  points the next downstream docs lane at `P14`
- `results/H25_refreeze_after_r30_r31_decision_packet/summary.json` records
  the preserved historical same-endpoint operational decision packet: `H23`
  stays the frozen scientific state, `R32` becomes the primary next lane,
  `R33` stays deferred, and `R29/F3` remain blocked
- `results/R30_d0_boundary_reauthorization_packet/summary.json` records the
  post-`H23` boundary decision that routes the next justified boundary work
  through one family-local `R32` sharp zoom rather than another historical
  full-grid expansion
- `results/R31_d0_same_endpoint_systems_recovery_reauthorization_packet/summary.json`
  records the post-`H23` systems decision that keeps direct `R29` reopening
  blocked and routes any later same-endpoint systems story through the
  narrower `R33` audit first
- `results/H22_post_h21_boundary_reopen_and_dual_track_lock/summary.json`
  records the bounded post-`H21` reopen-control packet
- `results/R26_d0_boundary_localization_execution_gate/summary.json` and
  `results/R27_d0_boundary_localization_extension_gate/summary.json` both
  preserve no-break-observed boundary packets rather than true boundary
  localization
- `results/R28_d0_trace_retrieval_contract_audit/summary.json` records the
  current mechanism-contract support result without turning it into a systems
  win
- `results/H21_refreeze_after_r22_r23/summary.json` remains the preserved
  immediate pre-reopen same-endpoint control state
- `results/H19_refreeze_and_next_scope_decision/summary.json` remains the
  preserved pre-`R22/R23` refrozen same-endpoint control state
- `results/H15_refreeze_and_decision_sync/summary.json` records the current
  preserved prior refrozen stage, leaves `R13` inactive, leaves `R14`
  unjustified, and shows zero blocked items
- `results/H14_core_first_reopen_guard/summary.json` shows zero blocked items
  on the preserved core-first reopen control surface
- `results/H13_post_h12_governance_stage_health/summary.json` shows zero
  blocked items on the preserved governance/runtime handoff
- `results/V1_full_suite_validation_runtime_audit/summary.json` records a
  successful collect-only inventory on the current suite
- `results/V1_full_suite_validation_runtime_timing_followup/summary.json`
  reports `healthy_but_slow` with zero timed-out files
- `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` reports either
  `dirty_worktree_release_commit_blocked` or
  `clean_worktree_ready_if_other_gates_green`, and does not report
  `content_issues_present`
- `results/release_preflight_checklist_audit/summary.json` reports
  `docs_and_audits_green`
- `results/P5_public_surface_sync/summary.json` shows zero blocked items
- `results/P5_callout_alignment/summary.json` shows zero blocked rows

- `results/P10_submission_archive_ready/summary.json` shows zero blocked items

## Restricted-source exclusion

Local-only source material under `docs/Origin/` and `docs/origin/` stays out of
the archival/public packet. The current public-safe docs mention those paths
only as excluded inputs, never as required release artifacts.

## Archive interpretation rule

This archive is evidence for a narrow mechanistic endpoint: append-only traces,
exact latest-write retrieval, bounded precision, and one tiny compiled
boundary on the active Origin-core substrate. It is not evidence for arbitrary
`C`, general LLM computation, or current-scope end-to-end systems superiority.
The landed `H32` packet preserves the `H29 -> R36 -> R37 -> H30 -> H31 -> R38`
chain as the current active routing state, `H33` preserves the one-question
selection packet, `R39` preserves one narrow same-substrate dependency audit,
and `H34` preserves the complete-for-now interpretation above that chain while
leaving no active downstream runtime lane. `H27/H28` explain the pivot away
from the older same-endpoint route. The preserved `H23` packet strengthens same-endpoint
boundary and mechanism evidence inside the fixed `D0` boundary, but it still
does not localize the true executor boundary, still preserves only partial
control isolation, and still does not overturn the mixed same-endpoint systems
gate. The later `R30/R31/H25` stack does not widen that science claim set; it
only records the downstream routing `R32 -> deferred R33 -> blocked R29/F3`.
