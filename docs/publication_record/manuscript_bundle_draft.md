# Manuscript Bundle

Status note: this file is the current paper-shaped prose baseline and is now
aligned to the landed `H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34` control chain. Preserved
same-endpoint materials below `H28` remain relevant as historical negative or
mixed context, but the current manuscript endpoint is the narrow Origin-core
line rather than any post-`H21` placeholder horizon. If prose and a landed
packet ever differ, trust `current_stage_driver.md`, `claim_ladder.md`,
`claim_evidence_table.md`, and `release_summary_draft.md`.

## 1. Abstract

We revisit a field-note claim that large language model mechanisms can behave
like computation, but we freeze the paper around a narrower reproduction target:
append-only execution traces, exact latest-write retrieval, and a small exact
executor under explicit boundaries. On the current evidence bundle, the
mechanism story remains positive at this narrower level: append-only trace
semantics and exact retrieval survive, and the active compiled line now
supports one tiny lowered bytecode subset plus one richer same-substrate
control/call family, with one declared dependency audit closing the line
complete-for-now. The precision story is positive but bounded rather than
open-ended.
Float32 single-head fails on 12 of 25 tracked real-trace streams, with 7
failing already at `1x`, while at least one decomposition configuration
remains exact on all 25 tracked streams in the validated suite. The systems
story is mixed. Cached retrieval retains a strong asymptotic advantage on the
geometry benchmark, but the current lowered `exec_trace` path remains about
`1.82x` slower than the best current reference/oracle path on the preserved
positive same-endpoint compiled suites, and the later same-endpoint `R23`
recheck still leaves
`pointer_like_exact` about `4.16x` slower than the best current reference path
despite preserving exactness on `25/25` rows. We therefore keep the compiled
endpoint narrow and same-substrate, and we treat broader claims about
arbitrary `C`, general LLM computation, or current end-to-end competitiveness
as unsupported. Stopping at this narrow compiled line is therefore part of the
current scientific conclusion, not an implementation gap waiting to be filled.

## 2. Introduction and Claim Ladder

The motivating source text is valuable because it points toward a concrete
mechanistic idea: computation can be rewritten as an append-only execution
trace, and key read operations can be phrased as exact latest-write retrieval.
What it does not provide is a paper-grade boundary for which parts of that
story actually survive when every claim must be tied to auditable artifacts,
free-running exactness, and explicit negative results. The present work
therefore treats reproduction as a narrowing process rather than a branding
exercise. Its target is not “LLMs are computers” in the broad rhetorical sense,
but a smaller question: which mechanism-level and compiled-boundary claims
remain defensible after the evidence is frozen and mixed or negative results
are kept in view?

Under that narrower reading, the paper makes three contributions. First, it
keeps the append-only trace substrate and exact retrieval story intact on the
current validated scope. Second, it closes two important boundaries instead of
silently skipping them: staged-neural execution remains caveated by legality
structure, and real-trace precision remains positive only within an explicitly
narrow current-suite boundary. Third, it shows that the first compiled endpoint
has become a narrow same-substrate line: one tiny lowered bytecode subset is
exact and auditable, one richer control/call family also survives, and the
`H33/R39/H34` chain then freezes that line complete-for-now instead of
widening to a broader frontend.

The introduction closes by pointing readers to two paired main-text artifacts.
A claim-ladder figure plus evidence matrix orients the narrowed mechanism
story that survives the freeze, while a separate supported-versus-unsupported
claims table keeps the excluded broader readings explicit and auditable. Those
unsupported rows are part of the result rather than placeholders for broader
interpretation.
In the fixed main-text order, the claim-ladder pair comes first and the
supported-versus-unsupported claims table follows it immediately.

## 3. Methods: Trace Substrate and Exact Retrieval

The methods section is anchored in exact semantics rather than model
performance.

### 3.1 Trace substrate semantics

The core representation is an append-only execution trace whose events expose
the bounded state updates needed for state recovery: stack pops and pushes,
branch decisions, program-counter transitions, and latest memory writes.
Under that representation, the relevant executor state is no longer treated as
opaque latent memory. It is exposed as a causal history that can be audited
event by event against exact execution semantics.

### 3.2 Exact retrieval and geometry signal

Once the trace is written in that form, the key read operations in the current
scope become exact causal retrieval problems rather than latent-state
reconstruction. Latest-write memory reads and stack-slot reads are phrased as
2D hard-max retrieval over keys that encode both content address and temporal
priority, and the current brute-force and specialized retrieval paths agree on
the validated examples. The geometry benchmark belongs here only as evidence
that exact retrieval admits a meaningful asymptotic signal. That signal stays
separate from any broader claim that the full current system is already
competitive end to end. In the current paper layout, this section stays
prose-first: the claim-bearing figure/table pairs appear in the frozen order
where they support boundary claims rather than method-only exposition.

## 4. Executor Branches and Negative Controls

The executor results are best read as a progression from exactness by
construction toward learned or partially learned decision rules, with the
evaluation criterion fixed throughout: free-running exactness, not local label
fit alone. Exact and induced branches show that the append-only substrate can
support a small executor on the current toy scope. The harder question is what
survives once event decisions are predicted rather than derived. Here the
staged pointer decoder is the strongest learned branch, but its success remains
conditional on legality structure. On the widened staged suite, the fairer
`opcode_shape` regime collapses to `0.0` held-out exact rollout, while
`opcode_legal` remains exact only because stronger legality constraints remove
impossible combinations at decode time. The negative controls matter for the
same reason: they share the task surface and still fail. The event-level
softmax baseline remains at zero exact rollout despite nonzero teacher-forced
head accuracies. The pointer-space softmax baseline remains at `0.0`
exact-label accuracy, with structural rollout still at `0.0 / 0.0` on the
exported train/held-out slice. These failures make the staged branch's partial
success informative without turning it into a general neural-executor claim.

This section is therefore organized around one regime-comparison figure and one
negative-control comparison. The first shows that exact rollout survives only
under stronger legality structure, and the second shows that nearby softmax
baselines still fail under the same free-running criterion. Read together, they
support a bounded structural claim rather than a general learned-executor
result.

## 5. Mask Dependence and Failure Provenance

The staged follow-up is a closure step rather than a rescue attempt. Once the
widened suite is included, the fair positive interpretation does not survive:
the held-out `opcode_shape` regime no longer supports exact rollout, and the
only exact regime is the stronger `opcode_legal` diagnostic. The provenance
results then narrow the explanation further. The cleaned failure taxonomy
separates direct semantic errors from downstream runtime failure and shows
that many `step_budget` rows are downstream nontermination after an earlier
semantic divergence. On the `opcode_shape` slice, the root-cause head is
consistently `push_expr_0`, with the remaining failures explained by
downstream consequences rather than a separate hidden regime. The staged story
therefore ends as a sharper negative closure: legality structure still
matters, and the paper says so directly.

A provenance-backed staged failure taxonomy figure carries this section's main
evidence, separating root semantic mistakes from downstream runtime fallout
rather than implying a hidden positive regime.

## 6. Precision Boundary on Real / Organic Traces

The precision section makes one bounded claim and then stops. On the current
exported real and organic trace families, float32 single-head latest-write
retrieval fails early often enough that broad robustness language is no longer
defensible: 12 of 25 tracked streams fail under the single-head scheme,
and 7 of those fail already at `1x`. At the same time, the results are not
purely negative. At least one decomposition configuration remains exact on all
25 tracked streams in the validated suite, and the failures that do appear are
not arbitrary. The current observed failure mode is still `tie_collapse`, and
the families where decomposition helps most are the memory-heavy streams where
single-head addressing fails early. The correct paper claim is therefore a
narrow positive result with a clear boundary: decomposition materially helps on
the current validated suite, but nothing here supports universal base or
horizon claims across unseen trace families or a broad long-horizon robustness
result.

The main-text support here stays compact: one real-trace boundary figure shows
where failures first appear across schemes, and one boundary table makes the
current `12/25`, `7/25`, and `25/25` claims auditable without opening new
generalization rhetoric.

## 7. Systems Gate

The systems result is deliberately reported as a gate rather than as a victory
lap. On the positive side, the original mechanism intuition still has genuine
system-level content: on the current geometry benchmark, cached retrieval is
faster than brute-force history search at every tested history size and yields
speedups from about `42.8x` to `249.2x` as history grows. That asymptotic
signal, however, is not the same thing as present end-to-end competitiveness on
the compiled scope that the paper actually validates. When measured on the
preserved positive same-endpoint compiled suites, the lowered `exec_trace`
path still has a median cost of roughly `6458 ns/step`, compared with about
`6028 ns/step` for the bytecode path and `3540 ns/step` for the best current
reference/oracle path.
The later same-endpoint `R23` follow-up had upgraded `pointer_like_exact` into
that old route's first-class runtime candidate and kept exactness on `25/25`
full-suite rows, but it still remained about `4.16x` slower than the best
current reference path. The correct conclusion is therefore mixed and
operational: the specialized retrieval mechanism is real, the same-endpoint
runtime candidate improved materially, but on the present validated scope it
still does not justify broader frontend widening or a general
system-superiority claim.

In the current layout, this result remains a quantified main-text paragraph
rather than a standalone table. The main text needs the mixed gate decision and
its key timing anchors, while the full baseline matrix and runtime rows stay in
companion artifacts unless a layout pass specifically promotes a compact gate
table. If that promotion happens, the compact systems table should treat `R2`
and `R23` as one mixed chain rather than implying that the later follow-up
nearly overturned the gate.

## 8. Compiled Boundary

The compiled result is presented as a narrow same-substrate endpoint with one
explicit extension and one explicit stop. `R37` first shows that one admitted
tiny bytecode subset survives verifier/spec checks, lowered interpreter parity,
and accelerated free-running exact execution on the current append-only /
exact-retrieval / small-VM substrate. `H30` then freezes that result as narrow
compiled-boundary evidence only. `H31` authorizes exactly one further same-
substrate extension, `R38` validates one richer control/call family plus one
longer same-family boundary probe without widening the opcode surface, and
`H32` freezes that richer family as complete narrow support rather than as a
bridge to a broader compiler claim.

The downstream `H33 -> R39 -> H34` chain matters because it shows how the line
now stops. `H33` selects exactly one same-substrate next question instead of
automatic further runtime momentum. `R39` answers that question on one declared
helper-body permutation with target renumbering: exact source, lowered, and
free-running execution survive on both the admitted row and the named same-
family boundary probe; final state is preserved on both rows; and the trace
changes on both rows, so the perturbation is not a no-op. `H34` then
interprets that result as `freeze_compiled_boundary_as_complete_for_now`. The
meaning of the current paper endpoint is therefore explicit: the compiled line
is coherent and honest at the present tiny-plus-one-richer-family boundary, but
there is no active downstream runtime lane and no automatic reopen.

Preserved same-endpoint packets such as `R19/R20/R21/R22/R23/H21` remain useful
historical context because they sharpen what still does not follow from the
compiled evidence: no true executor boundary was localized on that older route,
the same-endpoint systems story remained mixed-to-negative, and wider frontend
or arbitrary-`C` rhetoric never became justified. In the current manuscript,
those rows support blocked-claim discipline rather than acting as placeholders
for the next compiled packet.

The main text supports the current endpoint with two artifacts: a frontend
boundary diagram that makes the preserved first compiled slice explicit and
anchors the current no-widening boundary, and an exact-trace / final-state
success table that records what the current starter suite does and does not
validate. Companion appendix material stays clearly downstream of that
endpoint: memory-surface diagnostics, stress/reference rows, the richer
same-substrate `R38` control-family evidence, and the declared `R39`
perturbation audit all help audit the current boundary, but they do not widen
it. In the fixed main-text order, the frontend boundary diagram appears before
the exact-trace/final-state success table.

## 9. Negative Results and Threats

The negative-results section reads as part of the argument rather than as
cleanup. Several tempting broader claims now have explicit contrary evidence or
explicitly missing support: the project does not validate general LLM
computation, arbitrary `C` reproduction, broader compiled demos, fair-regime
staged-pointer exactness, broad long-horizon precision robustness, or
current-scope end-to-end runtime superiority. These are not all the same kind
of limitation, and the section keeps them distinct. Some are failures of
learned execution under fair decode regimes; some are bounded precision
results; some are systems-level no-go findings; and some are deliberate scope
cuts made to avoid inflating the narrow compiled line into a broader language
claim. Keeping these
rows explicit is scientifically useful because it prevents the paper from
borrowing rhetorical force from the motivating field note while quietly
dropping the parts that did not survive the evidence freeze.

The current `H34` closeout sharpens that discipline. `R39` weakens one specific
"compiler did all the work" objection by showing that one declared helper-body
permutation with target renumbering preserves exact execution and final state
on the audited rows, but it does not prove arbitrary control-surface freedom,
broader compiler-family support, or a reopen-worthy new positive lane. `H34`
therefore matters as much as `R39`: it records that no unique sharper
same-substrate contradiction survived the current audit and leaves no active
downstream runtime lane. That means negative or unsupported rows stay blocked
by design, not by temporary prose omission.

Historical same-endpoint rows remain first-class threats language where they
still sharpen blocked claims. `R22` is not a hidden positive systems result; it
is a harder no-break-observed boundary scan that still fails to localize the
true executor boundary. `R23` is not a softened near-win; it is a mixed same-
endpoint systems recheck that preserves exactness but still fails the bounded
competitiveness goal. `H21` and the later `H27` closeout matter because they
freeze those rows into the preserved claim partition instead of leaving them as
operational footnotes. The external-validity point then follows directly: the
current bundle is a narrow, auditable endpoint, not a disguised claim about
general language-model computation.

A compact threats-to-validity table makes those boundary rows explicit,
keeping failures of learned execution, finite-precision limits, systems no-go
results, same-substrate stop conditions, and deliberate scope cuts visible as
distinct reasons rather than as a single undifferentiated limitation paragraph.

## 10. Reproducibility Appendix

The appendix makes the current paper bundle auditable and regenerable without
inflating companion diagnostics into new main-text claims. The guiding rule is
simple: main text carries the distilled claim-bearing evidence, while the
appendix carries regeneration commands, artifact maps, and companion views that
strengthen auditability on the same frozen scope. The current appendix
therefore has three jobs. First, it points readers to the canonical paper-ready
bundle under `results/P1_paper_readiness/`, which contains rendered figures,
table sources, and machine-readable bundle summaries. Second, it records how to
regenerate the public-safe result bundles that matter for the compiled
boundary, paper assembly, and release gate, with the current control chain
ending explicitly at `R37 -> H30 -> H31 -> R38 -> H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34`.
Third, it keeps companion diagnostics such as memory-surface views, per-stream
precision catalogs, full staged failure digests, and the richer same-substrate
compiled audit materials visible and inspectable without letting them mutate
into broader claims.

Release-hygiene and packaging ledgers belong here for the same reason: they
make the research engineering process reproducible and inspectable, but they
remain downstream of the scientific argument itself. The appendix layout stays
anchored in four companion bundles: the `P1` paper-ready artifact set, the
current compiled-boundary companion diagnostics (`R37/R38/R39/H34` plus the
paper-facing tables and diagrams), the release/readiness ledgers that keep the
package regenerable, and one preserved historical-context bundle for older
same-endpoint rows that still inform blocked claims. Those historical rows are
included as archived context only. They are no longer reserved as the current
paper-assembly horizon, and they do not imply an active downstream runtime lane
after `H34`.
