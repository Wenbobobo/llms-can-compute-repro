# Manuscript Bundle Draft

Status: section-ordered draft bundle for monotonic expansion after the `M7`
no-go decision. This file is not final paper prose, but future drafting should
prefer extending it over re-planning section scope.

## 1. Abstract

We revisit a field-note claim that large language model mechanisms can behave
like computation, but we freeze the paper around a narrower reproduction target:
append-only execution traces, exact latest-write retrieval, and a small exact
executor under explicit boundaries. On the current public artifact surface, the
mechanism story remains positive at this narrower level: append-only trace
semantics and exact retrieval survive, and a tiny typed-bytecode `D0` slice
achieves exact trace or exact final-state agreement on the frozen starter
suite. The precision story is positive but bounded rather than open-ended:
float32 single-head fails on 12 of 25 tracked real-trace streams, with 7
failing already at `1x`, while at least one decomposition configuration
remains exact on all 25 tracked streams in the validated suite. The systems
story is mixed: cached retrieval retains a strong asymptotic advantage on the
geometry benchmark, but the current lowered `exec_trace` path remains about
`1.82x` slower than the best current reference/oracle path on the positive
`D0` suites. We therefore keep the compiled endpoint at tiny typed bytecode and
treat broader claims about arbitrary C, general LLM computation, or current
end-to-end competitiveness as unsupported.

## 2. Introduction and Claim Ladder

The motivating source text is valuable because it points toward a concrete
mechanistic idea: computation can be rewritten as an append-only execution
trace, and key read operations can be phrased as exact latest-write retrieval.
What it does not provide is a paper-grade boundary for which parts of that
story actually survive when every claim must be tied to auditable artifacts,
free-running exactness, and explicit negative results. The present work
therefore treats reproduction as a narrowing process rather than a branding
exercise. Its target is not “LLMs are computers” in the broad rhetorical sense,
but a smaller question: which mechanism-level and compiled-boundary claims
remain defensible after the evidence is frozen and mixed or negative results
are kept in view?

Under that narrower reading, the paper makes three contributions. First, it
keeps the append-only trace substrate and exact retrieval story intact on the
current validated scope. Second, it closes two important boundaries instead of
silently skipping them: staged-neural execution remains caveated by legality
structure, and real-trace precision remains positive only within an explicitly
narrow current-suite boundary. Third, it shows that the first compiled endpoint
should remain at tiny typed bytecode `D0`: the current slice is exact and
auditable, but the systems gate is mixed and therefore does not justify
widening to a broader frontend.

Main items:
- claim ladder + evidence matrix;
- supported vs unsupported claims table.

Boundary note:
- unsupported claims are outputs of the paper, not future-work placeholders.

## 3. Methods: Trace Substrate and Exact Retrieval

The methods section is anchored in exact semantics rather than model
performance. The core representation is an append-only execution trace whose
events expose the bounded state updates needed for later recovery: stack pops
and pushes, branch decisions, next-program-counter transitions, and latest
memory writes. Under that representation, the key read operations in the
current scope become exact causal retrieval problems rather than opaque latent
state recovery. Latest-write memory reads and stack-slot reads are phrased as
2D hard-max retrieval over keys that encode both content address and temporal
priority, and the current brute-force and specialized retrieval paths agree on
the validated examples. The geometry benchmark belongs here only as evidence
that exact retrieval admits a meaningful asymptotic signal. It should not be
allowed to blur into a broader claim that the full current system is already
competitive end to end.

## 4. Executor Branches and Negative Controls

The executor results are best read as a progression from exactness by
construction toward learned or partially learned decision rules, with the
evaluation criterion fixed throughout: free-running exactness, not local label
fit alone. Exact and induced branches show that the append-only substrate can
support a small executor on the current toy scope. The harder question is what
survives once event decisions are predicted rather than derived. Here the
staged pointer decoder is the strongest learned branch, but its success remains
conditional on legality structure. On the widened staged suite, the fairer
`opcode_shape` regime collapses to `0.0` held-out exact rollout, while
`opcode_legal` remains exact only because stronger legality constraints remove
impossible combinations at decode time. The negative controls matter for the
same reason: they share the task surface and still fail. The event-level
softmax baseline remains at zero exact rollout despite nonzero teacher-forced
head accuracies, and the pointer-space softmax baseline remains at `0.0`
exact-label accuracy with structural rollout still at `0.0 / 0.0` on the
exported train/held-out slice. These failures make the staged branch's partial
success informative without turning it into a general neural-executor claim.

Main items:
- staged decode regime comparison;
- negative-control comparison.

## 5. Mask Dependence and Failure Provenance

The staged follow-up is a closure step rather than a rescue attempt. Once the
widened suite is included, the fair positive interpretation does not survive:
the held-out `opcode_shape` regime no longer supports exact rollout, and the
only exact regime is the stronger `opcode_legal` diagnostic. The provenance
results then narrow the explanation further. The cleaned failure taxonomy
separates direct semantic errors from later runtime failure and shows that many
`step_budget` rows are downstream nontermination after an earlier semantic
divergence. On the `opcode_shape` slice, the root-cause head is consistently
`push_expr_0`, with the remaining failures explained by downstream
consequences rather than a separate hidden regime. The staged story therefore
ends as a sharper negative closure: legality structure still matters, and the
paper should say so directly.

Main item:
- provenance-backed staged failure taxonomy figure.

## 6. Precision Boundary on Real / Organic Traces

The precision section should make one bounded claim and then stop. On the
current exported real and organic trace families, float32 single-head latest-
write retrieval fails early often enough that broad robustness language is no
longer defensible: 12 of 25 tracked streams fail under the single-head scheme,
and 7 of those fail already at `1x`. At the same time, the results are not
purely negative. At least one decomposition configuration remains exact on all
25 tracked streams in the validated suite, and the failures that do appear are
not arbitrary. The current observed failure mode is still `tie_collapse`, and
the families where decomposition helps most are the memory-heavy streams where
single-head addressing fails early. The correct paper claim is therefore a
narrow positive-with-boundary statement: decomposition materially helps on the
current validated suite, but nothing here supports universal base or horizon
claims across unseen trace families or a broad long-horizon robustness result.

Main items:
- real-trace precision boundary figure;
- real-trace precision boundary table.

## 7. Systems Gate

The systems result is deliberately reported as a gate rather than as a victory
lap. On the positive side, the original mechanism intuition still has genuine
system-level content: on the current geometry benchmark, cached retrieval is
faster than brute-force history search at every tested history size and yields
speedups from about `42.8x` to `249.2x` as history grows. That asymptotic
signal, however, is not the same thing as present end-to-end competitiveness on
the compiled scope that the paper actually validates. When measured on the
current positive `D0` suites, the lowered `exec_trace` path still has a median
cost of roughly `6458 ns/step`, compared with about `6028 ns/step` for the
bytecode path and `3540 ns/step` for the best current reference/oracle path.
The correct conclusion is therefore mixed and operational: the specialized
retrieval mechanism is real, but on the present validated scope it does not yet
justify broader frontend widening or a general system-superiority claim.

Current layout choice:
- keep `R2` as a main-text paragraph with quantitative sentences;
- keep the full baseline matrix and runtime rows out of the main text unless a
  later layout pass specifically promotes a compact table.

## 8. Compiled Boundary

The compiled result should be presented as an endpoint, not as a teaser. The
current paper validates a tiny typed-bytecode `D0` slice with deterministic
verification, exact-trace and exact-final-state agreement on the frozen starter
suite, one stress/reference follow-up tied to a standalone Python spec oracle,
and appendix-level memory-surface diagnostics that help audit the boundary
without widening it. This is sufficient for a first compiled boundary claim,
but not for a broader source-language claim. The subsequent `M7` decision is
therefore not an administrative footnote; it is part of the scientific
conclusion. Because the systems gate remains mixed and because the current
evidence bundle already closes the narrow compiled claim, the project stops at
tiny typed bytecode rather than widening toward Wasm-like or arbitrary-C
language coverage.

Main items:
- frontend boundary diagram;
- exact-trace / final-state success table.

Appendix companions:
- memory-surface diagnostics;
- stress/reference companion rows beyond the main `D0` summary.

## 9. Negative Results and Threats

The negative-results section should read as part of the argument rather than as
cleanup. Several tempting broader claims now have explicit contrary evidence or
explicitly missing support: the project does not validate general LLM
computation, arbitrary C reproduction, broader compiled demos, fair-regime
staged-pointer exactness, broad long-horizon precision robustness, or
current-scope end-to-end runtime superiority. These are not all the same kind
of limitation, and the section should keep them distinct. Some are failures of
learned execution under fair decode regimes; some are bounded precision
results; some are systems-level no-go findings; and some are deliberate scope
cuts made to avoid inflating `D0` into a broader language claim. Keeping these
rows explicit is scientifically useful because it prevents the paper from
borrowing rhetorical force from the motivating field note while quietly
dropping the parts that did not survive the evidence freeze. The threats
section then makes the matching external-validity point: the current bundle is
a narrow, auditable endpoint, not a disguised claim about general
language-model computation.

Main item:
- threats-to-validity table.

## 10. Reproducibility Appendix

Section target:
- collect regeneration commands, artifact ledgers, public-safe packaging
  boundaries, and companion diagnostics.

Required beats:
- point to `experiment_manifest.md` and `results/P1_paper_readiness/`;
- keep release-hygiene details downstream of the scientific argument;
- preserve appendix-only placement for memory-surface and per-stream precision
  artifacts.
