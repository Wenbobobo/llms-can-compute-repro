# Paper Outline

Status: manuscript skeleton for the current narrow no-widening scope under
active `H32` plus docs-only `H34`, with preserved same-endpoint controls kept
as historical context rather than the current paper target.

## 1. Abstract

- State the narrow target: append-only execution traces, exact retrieval, and a
  small exact executor with a tiny compiled endpoint.
- Report the surviving positive evidence from `R34/R35`, the narrowed
  precision boundary from `R36`, the mixed systems gate preserved through the
  old same-endpoint route, and the current compiled-boundary closeout through
  `R37 -> H30 -> H31 -> R38 -> H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34`.
- Explicitly reject broader claims about general LLM computation, arbitrary
  `C`, automatic reopen, or demo-first evidence.

## 2. Introduction and Claim Ladder

- Explain why the source field note motivated the work but overstated the final
  scope.
- Present the current claim ladder as the paper's actual target, not a teaser
  for future scope.
- Clarify up front that the paper is a reproduction-plus-boundary study with a
  deliberate no-widening endpoint.

## 3. Methods: Trace Substrate and Exact Retrieval

- Define the append-only execution-trace representation and reference
  interpreter semantics.
- Describe exact latest-write retrieval and the geometry benchmark that
  establishes the asymptotic retrieval signal.
- Keep the mechanism framing separate from any broader language/runtime claims.

## 4. Executor Branches and Negative Controls

- Summarize the exact, induced, opcode-conditioned, and staged-neural branches.
- Separate teacher-forced success from free-running exactness.
- Include the direct event-value collapse and softmax baselines as genuine
  negative controls, not as side notes.

## 5. Mask Dependence and Failure Provenance

- Explain why the fair fourth staged regime did not survive the expanded suite.
- Use the provenance follow-up to show that later `step_budget` failures are
  downstream symptoms of earlier semantic mistakes.
- Keep the conclusion narrow: staged success remains caveated by stronger
  legality structure.

## 6. Precision Boundary on Real / Organic Traces

- State the `R36` boundary in one sentence: where single-head fails, where
  decomposition helps, and what remains unsupported.
- Use the current broadened current-suite framing rather than open-ended
  long-horizon rhetoric.
- Keep figure/table roles tightly tied to the exported `R36` bundle.

## 7. Systems Gate

- Separate asymptotic retrieval value from current-scope end-to-end runtime
  value.
- Report the mixed result plainly: geometry is strongly positive, but the
  lowered path is not yet competitive on the preserved positive same-endpoint
  compiled suites, and the preserved same-endpoint systems follow-up never
  overturned that gate.
- Make this mixed result one reason the paper stops short of a broader runtime
  claim.

## 8. Compiled Boundary

- Present the tiny typed-bytecode `D0` slice as the first compiled boundary.
- Show how `R37` establishes the tiny subset, `H30` freezes it, `H31` permits
  exactly one same-substrate extension, `R38` validates one richer control/call
  family, and `H32` freezes that line narrowly.
- Explain how `H33 -> R39 -> H34` closes the current compiled narrative:
  one declared helper-body permutation survives, but `H34` still selects
  `freeze_compiled_boundary_as_complete_for_now` with no active downstream
  runtime lane.

## 9. Threats, Unsupported Claims, and Release Discipline

- Consolidate unsupported claims from the claim/evidence ledgers and preserved
  same-endpoint negative packets.
- Fold `negative_results.md` and `threats_to_validity.md` into one coherent
  boundary statement.
- Explain why the blog remains blocked, why README-level restraint is part of
  the scientific discipline, and why `H34` does not count as a reopen.

## 10. Reproducibility Appendix

- Collect regeneration commands, artifact ledgers, and figure/table source
  paths.
- Keep memory-surface diagnostics, richer same-substrate audits, and preserved
  same-endpoint historical context appendix-level unless they directly support
  a main-text claim.
- Point to the public-safe packaging ledger and the current control docs for
  outward release boundaries.
