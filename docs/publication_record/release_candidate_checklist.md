# Release Candidate Checklist

State: `standing_gate`.

This checklist defines the minimum outward-facing sync required for a restrained
release-candidate state after the current submission-candidate bundle lock on
the current `H45` active docs-only decision packet plus preserved prior `H44`
route packet plus `H43` paper-grade useful-case refreeze /
`H36` preserved-active / `R42-R43-R44-R45-R46` completed semantic-boundary
gate stack / next exact `R47` plus blocked `F22` /
`P28-P27` completed downstream sync-and-explicit-merge posture /
`F20-F16-F17-F18-F19-F15` current-control-support /
`H42-H41-H40-H38-H37-P26-P25` preserved immediate-predecessor support /
`H35-H34-H33-H32-H31-H30` preserved question-selection-and-decision /
`H29` preserved-upstream-refreeze / `H27-H28`
preserved-closeout-and-pivot stack.

## Wording and scope

- [ ] `README.md` keeps the narrow endpoint and blocked non-goals explicit.
- [ ] `STATUS.md` matches the same frozen scope and the current next action
  recorded by active `H45`, preserved prior `H44`, landed `R46`, preserved
  `H43/H42/H41/H40/H38/H37`, preserved `H36`, completed
  `R42/R43/R44/R45/R46`, next exact `R47`, blocked `F22`, completed
  `P28/P27`, current `F20/F16/F17/F18/F19`, preserved `P26/P25`, and current
  `F15`.
- [ ] `release_summary_draft.md` remains the short public-surface source.
- [ ] `P20`, `F5`, and `F6` remain aligned with the same no-reopen
  interpretation and do not imply a new evidence wave.
- [ ] `F7`, `F8`, `F10`, `F12`, `F13`, `F14`, and `P23` remain aligned with
  that same planning-only no-reopen interpretation, while `P21/P22` stay
  preserved prior syncs, `F9` stays blocked, `F11` stays new-substrate, and
  none of them imply a new evidence wave, `R41`, merge authorization, or a
  broadened runtime family.
- [ ] No outward wording implies a new evidence wave or broader compiled scope.

## Paper-facing dependencies

- [ ] `submission_candidate_criteria.md` is satisfied on the current repo state.
- [ ] `paper_bundle_status.md`, `layout_decision_log.md`, and
  `publication_record/README.md` all describe the same `H43` current /
  `H36` preserved active / `R42-R43-R44-R45` completed current gate stack /
  `P28-P27` completed operational sync-and-explicit-merge posture /
  `F20-F16-F17-F18-F19-F15` current support /
  `H42-H41-H40-H38-H37-P26-P25` preserved immediate-predecessor support /
  `H35-H34-H33-H32-H31-H30-H29-H27-H28` preserved current control package.
- [ ] `plans/README.md`, the saved post-`P20/F5/F6` handoff surfaces, and the
  saved post-`H34` planning-wave surface still present docs/planning
  maintenance as admissible while runtime remains inactive by default.
- [ ] `publication_record/README.md` and the saved planning-wave surfaces
  present the completed `F20/H41/P27/R43/R45/H42/R44/H43/P28` wave, the
  preserved `H40/R42/P26/F17/F18/F19/H38/F16/P25/F15/H37` support wave, the
  preserved `F7/F8/P21` wave, the preserved `F10/P22` bridge wave, and the
  preserved `F12/F13/F14/P23` family-first wave while keeping `F9` blocked
  and `F11` new-substrate.
- [ ] The blocked-blog rule remains explicit in both `blog_release_rules.md`
  and `blog_outline.md`.

## Release hygiene

- [ ] `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` is checked
  before the outward sync commit.
- [ ] No local-only source material under `docs/Origin/` or `docs/origin/`
  appears in public-facing docs or release notes.
- [ ] Blog work remains blocked unless this checklist and
  `blog_release_rules.md` are both satisfied in full.
