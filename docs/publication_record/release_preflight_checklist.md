# Release Preflight Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum outward-facing sync required after the
current freeze candidate is assembled.

## Wording and scope

- [ ] `README.md` stays a restrained landing page and keeps the current narrow
  non-goals explicit.
- [ ] `STATUS.md` reflects current `H54` as the active docs-only closeout
  packet, preserved prior `H52/H53/H50` as the mechanism-closeout and
  compiled-boundary reentry history, preserved `H43` as the paper-grade endpoint,
  preserved `H42/H41` prior docs-only packets, preserved `H36`
  routing/refreeze packet, completed `R42/R43/R44/R45/R58/R59` gate
  stack, blocked `F27/R53/R54`, current `F20/F16/F17/F18/F19/F29` bundles,
  completed `P27/P38` operational posture, preserved `P26/H40/H38/H37/P25`
  prior support lanes, current `F15` derivative bundle, and keeps
  `merge_executed = false`.
- [ ] `release_summary_draft.md` remains the source for short public-surface
  wording downstream of landed
  `H54/R59/R58/H53/F29/H52/H50/H43/H42/H41/F20/P27/P38/R45/R44/R43/H40/H36/R42`
  while preserving the narrow Origin-core limits and the paper-grade role of
  `H43`.
- [ ] `P20_post_h34_manuscript_narrative_resync`,
  `F5_post_h34_contradiction_scout_matrix`, and
  `F6_post_p20_future_option_matrix` remain aligned with the same no-reopen
  interpretation and do not imply a new runtime lane.
- [ ] `F7_post_h34_reopen_trigger_specification_bundle`,
  `F8_post_h34_beyond_origin_bridge_roadmap`,
  `F10_post_h34_executor_value_comparator_matrix`,
  `F12_post_f10_origin_claim_delta_reanchor_bundle`,
  `F13_post_f12_bounded_scalar_value_family_spec`,
  `F14_post_f13_conditional_reopen_readiness_bundle`, and
  `P23_post_f13_planning_surface_sync` remain aligned with the current
  post-`H37` no-reopen interpretation, while `P21/P22` stay preserved prior
  syncs, `F9` stays blocked, `F11` stays new-substrate, and none of them
  imply `R41`, merge authorization, or a broadened runtime family.

## Paper-facing ledgers

- [ ] `manuscript_bundle_draft.md` still matches the fixed section and artifact
  ownership on current scope.
- [ ] `paper_bundle_status.md`, `layout_decision_log.md`,
  `freeze_candidate_criteria.md`, `main_text_order.md`, and
  `appendix_companion_scope.md` remain synchronized.
- [ ] `release_candidate_checklist.md`, `submission_candidate_criteria.md`,
  `claim_ladder.md`, and `archival_repro_manifest.md` all expose the same
  current `H54/H52/H53/H50/H43/H36/R42/R43/R44/R45/R58/R59/P27/P38`
  release-control stack while preserving `H43` as the paper-grade endpoint and
  do not revert wording back to earlier `H40` or `H32/H34` control states.
- [ ] `publication_record/README.md` and `plans/README.md` both expose the
  completed `F29/H53/R58/R59/H54` closeout stack above preserved
  `H52/H43/H36`, the preserved `F7/F8/P21` wave, the preserved `F10/P22`
  bridge wave, and the preserved `F12/F13/F14/P23` family-first planning wave
  without widening wording.
- [ ] `blog_release_rules.md` still records the blocked-blog state explicitly.

## Release hygiene

- [ ] Use `results/release_worktree_hygiene_snapshot/summary.json` to decide
  whether an outward sync commit is currently blocked by a dirty tree.
- [ ] No local-only source material under `docs/Origin/` or `docs/origin/`
  enters the public surface.
- [ ] Blog work remains blocked unless `blog_release_rules.md` is satisfied in
  full.
