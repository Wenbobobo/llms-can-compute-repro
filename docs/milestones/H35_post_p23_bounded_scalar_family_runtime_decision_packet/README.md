# H35 Post-P23 Bounded Scalar Family Runtime Decision Packet

Executed docs-only decision packet after the completed `F12/F13/F14/P23`
planning wave.

`H35` keeps `H32` as the preserved upstream Origin-core refreeze packet under
the earlier `H34` no-runtime interpretation, but authorizes one sharper
same-substrate runtime question that was made explicit by `F13`:

- selected outcome:
  `authorize_one_bounded_scalar_family_runtime_gate`;
- non-selected alternative:
  `keep_no_runtime_lane_under_h34_for_now`;
- named future runtime candidate:
  `R40_origin_bounded_scalar_locals_and_flags_gate`.

The packet keeps the question narrow:

- explicit bounded frame locals only;
- explicit typed `FLAG` slots only;
- same substrate and same opcode surface only;
- no heap escape, no indirect address payloads, no aggregate values, no
  restricted-Wasm reopening, and no hybrid/planner bridge claim.

`H35` records `R41_origin_runtime_relevance_threat_stress_audit` only as a
deferred future blueprint after `R40`, not as an active runtime lane.
