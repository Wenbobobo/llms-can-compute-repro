# Brainstorm Log

- The first baseline run should answer whether teacher-forced success is hiding
  catastrophic rollout drift. It now does: the answer is yes.
- The current verbose serialization is interpretable but numerically brittle.
  It is suitable for a first scaffold and a first warning signal, not for a
  strong generalization claim.
- The next high-value `M5` ablation is probably representation, not model size.
  A larger model on the same serialization is likely to hide, rather than fix,
  the rollout problem.
