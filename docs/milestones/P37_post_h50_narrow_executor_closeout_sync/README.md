# P37 Post-H50 Narrow Executor Closeout Sync

Completed low-priority operational/docs sync packet for the post-`H50`
mechanism reentry wave.

`P37` does not alter the active scientific stage. It preserves `H51` as the
current active docs-only packet, preserves `H50` as the preserved prior
closeout, preserves `H43` as the paper-grade endpoint, and codifies the
worktree, artifact, and commit policy needed for
`F28 -> H51 -> R55 -> R56 -> R57 -> H52`.

The packet fixes:

- one worktree strategy note;
- one artifact policy note;
- one commit-cadence note;
- one acceptance note keeping dirty root `main` untouched during this wave; and
- one explicit split between compact in-git summaries and raw row dumps that
  stay out of git by default.
