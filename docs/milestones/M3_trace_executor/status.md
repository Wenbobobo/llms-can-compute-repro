# Status

The reference semantics branch now covers:

- stack-machine execution,
- deterministic replay,
- initial bounded RAM with explicit `LOAD/STORE`,
- runtime dynamic-address RAM with `LOAD_AT/STORE_AT`,
- latest-write reconstruction from append-only trace events.

Recorded artifacts:

- `results/M3_trace_executor/countdown_4_trace.json`
- `results/M3_trace_executor/latest_write_trace.json`
- `results/M3_trace_executor/memory_accumulator_trace.json`
- `results/M3_trace_executor/dynamic_memory_trace.json`

This remains a reference semantics branch, not yet a learned executor.
