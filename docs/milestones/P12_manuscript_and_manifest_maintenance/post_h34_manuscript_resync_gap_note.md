# Post-H34 Manuscript Resync Gap Note

## Purpose

This note records the remaining paper-facing gap after the landed
`H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34` chain and the later publication-control syncs.
It exists so later unattended work can distinguish between:

- publication ledgers and release/control docs that already reflect current
  routing;
- preserved historical manuscript notes tied to the older post-`H21` packet;
- the still-open task of rewriting the prose bundle to the current control
  state.

## Current authoritative state

- `H32_post_r38_compiled_boundary_refreeze` remains the current active routing
  packet.
- `H34_post_r39_later_explicit_scope_decision_packet` remains the current
  docs-only control packet above `H32`.
- `H33_post_h32_conditional_next_question_packet` remains the preserved prior
  question-selection packet.
- `R39_origin_compiler_control_surface_dependency_audit` remains completed
  downstream evidence, not a routing change by itself.
- there is no active downstream runtime lane after `H34`.

The authoritative current-control docs are therefore:

- `docs/publication_record/current_stage_driver.md`
- `docs/publication_record/claim_ladder.md`
- `docs/publication_record/claim_evidence_table.md`
- `docs/publication_record/release_summary_draft.md`

## Remaining prose gap

`docs/publication_record/manuscript_bundle_draft.md` is still usable as a
paper-shaped baseline, but later sections continue to describe preserved
post-`H21` placeholder packets as if they were the live paper-assembly
surface. That is now stale in routing terms even where the local scientific
facts remain defensible.

The largest remaining gaps are:

- later compiled-boundary prose still routes through preserved `R19-R23/H21`
  placeholder logic rather than the current `H32/H33/R39/H34` control chain;
- appendix and negative-result closeout text still treats the post-`H21`
  placeholder packet as the main paper-assembly horizon;
- derivative packs can now point at the right control docs, but the
  manuscript-sized prose bundle itself has not been fully rewritten.

## Suggested resync scope

1. Keep Sections 1-7 only where their wording still matches the current
   claim/evidence ledgers.
2. Rewrite the compiled-boundary, negative-results, and reproducibility
   sections so they terminate on `H32/H34` rather than post-`H21`
   placeholders.
3. Demote preserved same-endpoint material to explicit historical context
   beneath the current Origin-core line.
4. Recheck derivative packs only after the manuscript resync lands.

## Acceptance

- `manuscript_bundle_draft.md` no longer presents preserved post-`H21`
  placeholder packets as the current paper-assembly target.
- the compiled-boundary narrative stops at the current narrow same-substrate
  result set: `R37 -> H30 -> H31 -> R38 -> H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34`.
- `R39` is described as one declared helper-body permutation with target
  renumbering only.
- `H34` is described as complete-for-now docs-only interpretation with no
  active downstream runtime lane.
- derivative packs and release helpers remain downstream of that rewritten
  manuscript state.
