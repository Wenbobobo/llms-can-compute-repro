# Milestones Index

This directory stores milestone-local staging areas, result digests, and
planning bundles. Read the current driver first, not the directory name alone.

## Reading Order

1. `../publication_record/current_stage_driver.md`
2. `../../tmp/active_wave_plan.md`
3. the relevant milestone `README.md` / `status.md`

## Current Top Of Stack

- `H37_post_h36_runtime_relevance_decision_packet/` — current active docs-only
  decision packet keeping the `H36` freeze and leaving `R41` deferred.
- `H36_post_r40_bounded_scalar_family_refreeze/` — preserved prior active
  routing/refreeze packet freezing the bounded-scalar family narrowly on the
  current substrate.
- `P25_post_h36_clean_promotion_prep/` — completed operational clean
  promotion-prep lane from the real source-of-truth branch.
- `F15_post_h36_origin_goal_reanchor_bundle/` — current canonical
  origin-facing derivative bundle after the bounded-scalar wave.
- `H35_post_p23_bounded_scalar_family_runtime_decision_packet/` — preserved
  prior docs-only control packet that authorized exactly one bounded-scalar
  runtime gate.
- `P24_post_h36_bounded_scalar_runtime_sync/` — preserved prior docs-only
  control-surface sync after the landed `H35/R40/H36` wave.
- `H34_post_r39_later_explicit_scope_decision_packet/` — preserved earlier
  docs-only control packet that froze the compiled-boundary line
  complete-for-now before the bounded-scalar reopen.
- `H32_post_r38_compiled_boundary_refreeze/` — preserved earlier active
  compiled-boundary refreeze packet.
- `H33_post_h32_conditional_next_question_packet/` — preserved earlier
  docs-only control packet that selected the one justified next question.
- `H31_post_h30_later_explicit_boundary_decision_packet/` — preserved explicit
  authorization packet between `H30` and `R38`.
- `H30_post_r36_r37_scope_decision_packet/` — preserved prior compiled-boundary
  refreeze packet.
- `H29_refreeze_after_r34_r35_origin_core_gate/` — preserved upstream
  Origin-core refreeze packet.
- `H28_post_h27_origin_core_reanchor_packet/` — prior pivot packet that set the
  current Origin-core direction.
- `H27_refreeze_after_r32_r33_same_endpoint_decision/` — preserved closeout of
  the old same-endpoint recovery wave.

## Current Downstream Evidence Lanes

- `R34_origin_retrieval_primitive_contract_gate/` — frozen primitive evidence
  under `H29/H32`.
- `R35_origin_append_only_stack_vm_execution_gate/` — frozen exact execution
  evidence under `H29/H32`.
- `R36_origin_long_horizon_precision_scaling_gate/` — completed narrow
  precision-boundary lane.
- `R37_origin_compiler_boundary_gate/` — completed tiny compiled-boundary
  lane.
- `R38_origin_compiler_control_surface_extension_gate/` — completed richer
  compiled control-surface lane on the same opcode surface.
- `R39_origin_compiler_control_surface_dependency_audit/` — completed
  same-substrate dependency audit on one declared helper-body permutation with
  target renumbering; it preserves narrow scope and does not change routing by
  itself.
- `R40_origin_bounded_scalar_locals_and_flags_gate/` — completed bounded-
  scalar same-substrate runtime gate validating explicit frame locals plus
  typed `FLAG` slots on the same opcode surface.

## Completed Current-Wave Closeout

- `P17_h30_commit_hygiene_and_clean_worktree_promotion/` — completed docs-only
  closeout and clean-worktree packet-promotion lane before the later explicit
  packet.
- `P18_post_h32_clean_worktree_promotion/` — completed clean-branch closeout
  and promotion lane for the landed `H31/R38/H32` packet.
- `P19_post_h32_publication_surface_alignment/` — completed docs-only
  publication/control alignment after the saved post-`H32` planning surface.
- `P20_post_h34_manuscript_narrative_resync/` — completed docs-only manuscript
  and helper-doc resync so the paper-facing bundle terminates on
  `R37 -> H30 -> H31 -> R38 -> H32 -> H33 -> R39 -> H34`.
- `P21_post_h34_planning_surface_sync/` — completed docs-only planning-surface
  sync that recorded `F7/F8` as the first admissible follow-on surfaces while
  keeping runtime inactive.
- `P22_post_f10_planning_surface_sync/` — completed prior docs-only
  planning-surface sync for the `F10` bridge wave.
- `P23_post_f13_planning_surface_sync/` — completed docs-only planning-surface
  sync that recorded `F12/F13/F14` while keeping `F9` blocked, `F11`
  new-substrate, and runtime inactive.
- `P24_post_h36_bounded_scalar_runtime_sync/` — completed docs-only sync that
  recorded `H36` as active and no active downstream runtime lane after `R40`.
- `P25_post_h36_clean_promotion_prep/` — completed operational prep that fixes
  the clean promotion branch, source-of-truth inventory, and no-merge rule.

## Current Planning And Deferred Follow-Ons

- `F15_post_h36_origin_goal_reanchor_bundle/` — current canonical
  origin-facing derivative bundle anchored to the landed bounded-scalar state.
- `F14_post_f13_conditional_reopen_readiness_bundle/` — preserved planning-only
  bundle that stores one future contradiction-driven packet blueprint and one
  future runtime-audit blueprint without authorizing either one.
- `../plans/2026-03-23-post-h36-r41-runtime-relevance-threat-design.md` —
  saved future design surface for the deferred
  `R41_origin_runtime_relevance_threat_stress_audit` lane.
- `R41_origin_runtime_relevance_threat_stress_audit/` — deferred future
  same-substrate runtime-audit lane fixed to the two landed `R40` rows, the
  two surviving `F14` threat families, and explicit stop rules.
- `F7_post_h34_reopen_trigger_specification_bundle/` — planning-only bundle
  that turns future same-substrate reopen admissibility into one mechanical
  contradiction-packet specification.
- `F8_post_h34_beyond_origin_bridge_roadmap/` — planning-only bundle that maps
  the broader Origin-facing scientific vision into saved future milestone
  families without authorizing them now.
- `F10_post_h34_executor_value_comparator_matrix/` — planning-only bridge
  bundle that makes richer executor-visible value and comparator obligations
  explicit without authorizing runtime widening.
- `F12_post_f10_origin_claim_delta_reanchor_bundle/` — preserved historical
  canonical derivative surface for the earlier `H34/F10/P22` control state.
- `F13_post_f12_bounded_scalar_value_family_spec/` — preserved planning-only
  bounded family-first preactivation bundle for `bounded scalar locals and flags`.
- `F9_post_h34_restricted_wasm_semantic_boundary_roadmap/` — inactive roadmap
  storage for a later restricted-Wasm semantic-boundary family that remains
  blocked.
- `F11_post_h34_hybrid_planner_executor_bridge_roadmap/` — inactive roadmap
  storage for a later planner-plus-executor interface family that still
  requires a new substrate.

## Blocked Or Historical Lanes

- `R29_d0_same_endpoint_systems_recovery_execution_gate/` — blocked future
  same-endpoint systems lane.
- `F2_future_frontier_recheck_activation_matrix/` — planning-only frontier
  activation surface.
- `F3_post_h23_scope_lift_decision_bundle/` — blocked scope-lift gate.
- `F4_post_h23_origin_claim_delta_matrix/` — preserved historical
  origin-facing delta surface superseded first by `F12` and now by `F15`.
- `F5_post_h34_contradiction_scout_matrix/` — planning-only contradiction
  scout concluding no reopen candidate survives on the current evidence.
- `F6_post_p20_future_option_matrix/` — planning-only option matrix keeping
  docs/planning work admissible while runtime remains inactive by default.

## Current Rule

Do not activate a blocked or historical milestone from momentum. On the current
stack:

- `H37` is the active docs-only decision packet.
- `H36` is the preserved prior active routing/refreeze packet.
- `P25` is the completed operational promotion-prep lane, not merge
  authorization.
- `F15` is the current canonical derivative claim-delta surface.
- `H35` is the preserved prior docs-only control packet.
- `P24` is the preserved prior docs-only sync packet.
- `H34` and `H33` are preserved earlier docs-only packets.
- `H31` and `H30` are preserved upstream decision packets, not the next
  objective.
- `H29` and `H28` are preserved upstream refreeze/pivot evidence.
- `R34`, `R35`, `R36`, `R37`, and `R38` stay frozen as upstream support.
- `R39` and `R40` are complete downstream audits/gates, not active routing
  changes by themselves.
- `R41` is a deferred future runtime-audit design, not active work.
- `F12`, `F13`, and `F14` are preserved historical or planning surfaces, not
  runtime packets.
- `F9` remains blocked roadmap storage and `F11` remains new-substrate roadmap
  storage.
- no active downstream runtime lane exists after `H37`.
- `R29`, `F3`, and wider frontier/demo claims remain blocked without a new
  explicit packet.
