## Reading Rule

- treat `publication_record/current_stage_driver.md` as the canonical live
  router for which milestone is current;
- treat `P88` as the current salvage-screen and no-import decision wave;
- treat `P87` as the current paper-spine refresh and salvage shortlist wave;
- treat `P86` as the current dirty-root inventory and archive-replace map
  wave;
- treat `P85` as the current merged-main rebaseline and control-resync wave;
- treat `P84` as the preserved keep-set contraction and closeout wave;
- treat `P83` as preserved merged-source branch handoff lineage above the
  published `p75` branch;
- treat `P81/P82` as preserved immediate promotion-prep lineage, not current
  live control;
- treat `P77/P78/P79/P80` as the current archive-first convergence and handoff
  stack underneath `P85`;
- treat `P73` as the current local hygiene and shrink wave above `P72`;
- treat `P72` as the current archive polish and explicit stop handoff wave
  above `H65`;
- treat `P74/P75/P76` as the preserved immediate publication lineage that
  produced the current `p75` branch;
- treat `P69/P70/P71` as hygiene/control sidecars underneath `P72`;
- treat `P66/P67/P68`, `P63/P64/P65`, and `P60/P61/P62` as preserved prior
  live control, not current; and
- treat `F38` as dormant future only, not a live scientific route.
