# Status

## Working State

- M0 scaffold: complete
- M1 claims/scope docs: complete
- M2 geometry exactness: initial implementation added
- M3 trace executor: stack plus bounded-RAM reference semantics implemented
- M4 exact hard-max decode: deterministic latest-write bridge implemented for immediate and dynamic memory addressing
- Packaging fix: renamed the trace package to avoid the Python stdlib conflict
- Public GitHub repo created and initial push completed

## Immediate Next Actions

1. Export and inspect the updated `M4` decode artifact with dynamic addressing.
2. Decide whether stack-slot retrieval or mixed memory/stack traces should be the next exact hard-max target.
3. Start the first trainable `M4` slice only after the richer retrieval target is fixed.

## Known Blockers

- None at the repository/bootstrap layer.
- The main remaining risks are scientific: representation choices, tie semantics
  at scale, and how far the current fast path generalizes beyond the toy executor.
