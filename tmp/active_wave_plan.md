Immediate active wave:

`H50_post_r51_r52_scope_decision_packet` is now the current active docs-only
packet. It reads positive `R51` plus negative `R52` together, selects
`stop_as_exact_without_system_value`, restores
`no_active_downstream_runtime_lane`, and keeps
`F27_post_h50_bounded_trainable_or_transformed_executor_entry_bundle`
non-selected and inactive.
`F26_post_h49_origin_claim_delta_and_next_question_bundle` is now the
completed post-`H49` planning bundle. Its fixed sequence has now fully
landed: `R51_origin_memory_control_surface_sufficiency_gate` completed with
`memory_control_surface_supported_narrowly`, `R52_origin_internal_vs_external_executor_value_gate`
completed with `internal_route_lacks_bounded_value`, and
`H50_post_r51_r52_scope_decision_packet` completed as the explicit closeout.
`P36_post_h49_cleanline_hygiene_and_artifact_policy` is the current
low-priority operational/docs wave. It records that dirty root `main` remains
quarantined, that clean descendant worktrees are the only scientific
execution surfaces for this wave, that raw probe/per-read dumps remain out of
git by default, and that merge back to `main` remains non-executed during the
completed `F26 -> R51 -> R52 -> H50` sequence.
`P35_post_h47_research_record_rollup` is now the preserved prior low-priority
wave, while `P31/P32/P33/P34` remain preserved prior helper refresh packets.

  `authorize_r42_origin_append_only_memory_retrieval_contract_gate`.

  exact observations, including `1` duplicate/tie maximizer case and `3`
  default-row hits.

  `5/5` exact families, `4/4` exact core families, and the gated optional
  call/return family also exact.
- `R45` returns
  `coequal_model_lane_supported_without_replacing_exact` with `2/2` exact
  model modes and `10/10` exact family-mode rows.

  useful-case variants across the fixed `3/3` kernel ladder and keeps
  `translation_identity_exact_count = 8`.
- `R48` returns
  `useful_case_model_lane_supported_without_replacing_exact` with `2/2`
  admitted modes exact on the preserved `8/8` useful-case variants, while the
  trainable mode also stays exact on the explicit held-out `histogram16_u8`
  family (`3/3`).

  widened variants exact across the fixed `3/3` useful-case kernels, `30`
  precision rows exported, `7/9` `float32_single_head` failures by
  `tie_collapse`, and both admitted float32 recovery regimes exact on
  `bucket_a`, `bucket_b`, and `bucket_c`.

## Immediate Objectives

1. Preserve `H49` as the current active docs-only decision packet.
2. Preserve `H48` as the preserved prior docs-only decision packet.
3. Preserve `H43` as the current paper-grade endpoint and `H36` as the
   routing/refreeze packet underneath the stack.
4. Preserve completed `R47` as the decisive exact frontend bridge gate.
5. Preserve completed `R48` as comparator-only, non-substitutive useful-case
   model evidence.
6. Preserve completed `R50` as restricted tiny-`C` evidence only and restore
   `no_active_downstream_runtime_lane`.
6. Treat `H47` as the explicit narrow refreeze packet rather than widening by
   momentum.
7. Keep `F22` current as the comparator-planning bundle, not as substitute
   evidence.
8. Preserve completed `P27` as the operational merge packet without merging
   `main`.
9. Keep `R41` deferred until later explicit contradiction routing.
10. Avoid reopening `R29`, `F3`, `F11`, broader compiler/demo scope, or
    frontier widening by momentum.
11. Keep release/public audit surfaces downstream of `H43` without changing
    the scientific stage driver.
12. Record `P35` as the preserved prior low-priority operational/docs wave
    while keeping `P31/P32/P33/P34` preserved prior helper refresh packets.
13. Preserve `F23` as the current saved post-`H47` numeric-scaling planning
    bundle.
14. Treat completed `R49_origin_useful_case_numeric_scaling_gate` as the
    completed current numeric-scaling gate interpreted by landed
    `H48_post_r49_numeric_scaling_decision_packet`.
15. Keep `F24_post_h47_hybrid_executor_growth_bundle` dormant and
    non-authorized.
16. Treat `F25_post_h48_restricted_tinyc_lowering_bundle` as the completed
    current post-`H48` planning bundle rather than as pending future work.
17. Treat `R50_origin_restricted_tinyc_lowering_gate` as the completed current
    restricted tiny-`C` lowering gate interpreted by landed `H49`.
18. Treat `H49_post_r50_tinyc_lowering_decision_packet` as the current active
    docs-only closeout packet and restore
    `no_active_downstream_runtime_lane`.
19. Keep `P36_post_h48_falsification_closeout_bundle` as the explicit
    non-selected closeout route.
